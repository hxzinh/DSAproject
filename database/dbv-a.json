This is evidenced by the figures seen dancing to music which were engraved on the bronze drums unearthed at Dong Son (Thanh Hoa province) and lithophones discovered in Tay Nguyen Highlands and other relics. Besides royal court music, there was also a rich vein of music which was closely attached to the daily lives of the working masses. Thousands of diverse musical tunes have been collected from this source. From Quan Ho folk songs in the North to Hue songs (songs from the Perfume River), \"guessing game\" songs, satirical songs, joking songs and numerous songs in southern provinces, all are characterised by a profound sensibility and poetic, lyrical sense. After 1945, royal court music was underdeveloped.

It was built in his native land of Kien My village, Binh Thanh commune, T\u00e2y S\u01a1n district, some 45km from Quy Nhon City. Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 is one of three brothers who led the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Insurrection. In 1788, he led a great force advancing from Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n (Hu\u1ebf) to the North. It took 35 days and they exacted an overwhelming defeat on the Qing invaders near Th\u0103ng Long (now H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), thereby liberating the royal+capital.

Ca Tr\u00f9 appeared officially under Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00fd (11th century). First, it served royal and religious rituals and was called H\u00e1t Khu\u00f4n. Later, it was used in banquets, weddings, friendly meetings... and called H\u00e1t H\u00e0ng Ho\u1ea1 Ca Tr\u00f9 had bamboo castanets as principal+instrument. By beating time on tomtoms, spectators accompanied and praised the singer. Ca Tr\u00f9 was also called H\u00e1t Nh\u00e0 Tr\u00f2 (singing or dancing while pulling funny tricks), H\u00e1t Th\u01b0\u1edfng (Singing to be rewarded by king or mandarins), H\u00e1t C\u1eeda Quy\u1ec1n (singing in royal palaces), H\u00e1t C\u1eeda \u0110\u00ecnh (singing for religious rituals), H\u00e1t \u1ea3 \u0111\u00e0o (name of a famous songstress in the L\u00fd times).... Under the French domination, Ca Tr\u00f9 declined. Nowadays, it is restored as a type of original popular art\n- What is a Ca Tr\u00f9 declamation? Originally, Ca Tr\u00f9 was like ch\u00e8o singing and served at ceremonies and festivals in the northern delta. When these ceremonies and festivals were no longer held, Ca Tr\u00f9 became a type of chamber music serving as intellectual food for those who would like to enjoy music and poetry\n- Music and poetry are the basis of Ca Tr\u00f9 and decide which ensemble of principal instruments, musicians and subordinate instruments should provide the accompaniment. Ca Tr\u00f9 has many melodies that are sung differently, but the chief is singing-reciting: A singer and a musician playing a long-necked lute-like instrument. Also taking part is a member of the audience who expresses his appreciation and response by beating a drum. A rather special description fits the songstress of former days: \"Fine clothes, velvet turban, delicate bobtailed hair, a moon-shaped face, knife-sharp eyes, refined manners, with sweet words, mild as flowers, transparent as snow, her beauty and charm are second only to Kim V\u00e2n Ki\u1ec1u's...\" To perform as expected, the+singer must practise very hard and know many tunes. A male musician accompanies the singer. He too practises hard so as to be in perfect harmony with the singer. The music accompaniment consists of a \"ph\u00e1ch\" - a bamboo instrument beaten with two wooden sticks - and \"tr\u1ed1ng ch\u1ea7u\" - a drum beaten by a member of the audience in appreciation or comment. Of course, this member of the audience is very experienced at beating the drum - a single beat, three or five successive beats and nine beats at the climax to be \"in tune\" with the lute. A timely response by the drummer encourages the singer who knows that she has met someone who both understands and appreciates her talent. These three instruments: The lute, the \"ph\u00e1ch\" and the \"tr\u1ed1ng ch\u1ea7u\" are inseparable. Being a subordinate+instrument, the drum is essential as a bridge between the performer and audience. The harmonious combination of the lute, the \"ph\u00e1ch\" and the+human voice makes it a perfect performance as praised in these lines by V\u0169 Ho\u00e0ng Ch\u01b0\u01a1ng: Sweet phach, passionate lute mild smoke cushion. The sad voice lingers on in the middle of night. To enjoy Ca Tr\u00f9 is to enjoy both music and singing. The art of Ca Tr\u00f9 is both high and original. Its sound range originates from that of the lullaby in the Red River delta. Ca Tr\u00f9 - with water puppetry - is+indigenous to Vietnam. It is a valuable legacy for Vietnamese culture\n- Many talented poets like Chu M\u1ea1nh Trinh, Nguy\u1ec5n C\u00f4ng Tr\u1ee9, T\u00fa X\u01b0\u01a1ng, D\u01b0\u01a1ng Khu\u00ea and T\u1ea3n \u0110\u00e0 composed excellent tunes, extraordinarily pure and high-falutin to charm the audience.+At the beginning of the 20th century, before the 1945, there were many places where Ca Tr\u00f9 was performed: Kh\u00e2m Thi\u00ean, B\u1ed3 \u0110\u1ec1, L\u1ed9 Kh\u00ea (Hanoi); Quan Ba Mau, Qu\u1ef3nh C\u01b0 (H\u1ea3i Ph\u00f2ng) and throughout B\u1eafc Ninh, H\u1ea3i D\u01b0\u01a1ng and Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh provinces. But then, Ca Tr\u00f9 became C\u00f4 \u0110\u1ea7u - performed by a sing-song girl or type of geisha. The art of Ca Tr\u00f9 was forgotten because it was thought to be a product of the ruling+class; the singers whores and the audience no more than hedonists. Singers abandoned their careers because of this bias and inhabitants of the Kh\u00e2m Thi\u00ean area even left their homes because of it. Before 1976, musician Nguy\u1ec5n Xu\u00e2n Kho\u00e1t was the only Vietnamese musicologist to study Ca Tr\u00f9. Ca Tr\u00f9 artists are still rare now, but attention is being given their art. L\u1ed9 Kh\u00ea village, Phu Do (in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i) is considered the cradle of Ca Tr\u00f9 and on the 6th of the 4th lunar month and the 13th of the tenth lunar month each year, members of the Ca Tr\u00f9 circle hold initiator-worshipping celebrations Artists young and old sing the Ca Tr\u00f9, always beginning with two pieces: Non Mai and H\u1ed3ng H\u1ea1nh.+The artist who deserves most praise for the revival and world-wide spread of Ca Tr\u00f9 is Doctor-Professor Tr\u1ea7n V\u0103n Kh\u1ec7 He has recorded Ca Tr\u00f9, Quan H\u1ecd and ch\u00e8o songs and declamations and sent them to France for the UNESCO Musical Committee to study. As a result, many recordings of Ca Tr\u00f9 and Quan H\u1ecd songs have been made. The support of eminent artist Qu\u00e1ch Th\u1ecb H\u1ed3 has made the recordings a great success. All the original features of Ca Tr\u00f9 are prominent, and H\u1ed3 was evaluated by the Musical+Committee and awarded with an honorary commendation with these lines: \"We thank you for your contribution to the keeping of an original, traditional art legacy of Vietnam and an exceptional delicacy of mankind\". Since then, Vietnam has sent a delegation to an Asian tribute held in the People's Democratic Republic of Korea where Ho^`'s recordings were among the most honoured. A Ca Tr\u00f9 club has been established in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, a place for all of Vietnam's excellent Ca Tr\u00f9 artists. It not only revives an old+musical form but attracts foreign musicologists: American, English, German and Japanese. American researcher Mirada Krenzen has written a persuasive study, Vietnam's Traditional Music Process. It was presented at a seminar to discuss Vietnam's traditional music in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i in 1994. Krenzen possesses a deep knowledge of Ca Tr\u00f9 and has gained the admiration of Vietnamese musicologists. She wrote: \"Ca Tr\u00f9 seems to have a magic power, a fermented substance to charm the listeners. Once I understood Ca Tr\u00f9, I understood the Vietnamese people better\".

Some 60km from the provincial capital is P\u1eafc B\u00f3, a small hamlet in Truong Ha commune, H\u00e0 Qu\u1ea3ng district, close to the Vietnamese-Chinese border. In the local dialect, P\u1eafc B\u00f3 means watershed, where springs of clear water run. From Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean City, provincial capital of B\u1eafc Th\u00e1i province, you drive along Highway 3 to the towns of B\u1eafc C\u1ea1n and Phu Thong.

originates from Ancient Ch\u0103m Pa Kingdom. They live mainly in Ninh Thu\u1eadn, B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn, B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean. Belonging to M\u00e3 Lai-\u0110a \u0110\u1ea3o linguistic group, the Ch\u0103m people remains influenced by matriarchy and Indian culture. The ancient Ch\u0103m writing is Sanskrit-based. Hinduism+and Mohammedanism are their principal religions\n- THE UNIQUE CH\u0102M CULTURE: The Ch\u0103m culture is a unique tradition, contributing much to the+diversity and richness of the Vietnamese multi-ethnic culture. From the first century AD, the Ch\u0103m people received deep influences from Indian culture. In the 7th century AD, Ch\u0103m Pa was already a kingdom with a capital in Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u (now Qu\u1ea3ng Nam) with a temple dedicated to the Indian Valmiki and his famous epic, the Ramayana By the middle of the 8th century AD, their capital was shifted to Nha Trang and five years later to \u0110\u00f4ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng, 15 km away from Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u in the southeast.\n- The Ch\u0103m are one of the 53 ethnic groups in Vietnam and comprise various subgroups. There are around 98,000 Ch\u0103m people, including the Ch\u0103m Hroi in B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh, Ph\u00fa Y\u00ean and those living in Ninh Thu\u1eadn, B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn and other parts of southern Vietnam Inhabiting a large area, the Ch\u0103m also have many diversified customs and social practices. While most of the Ch\u0103m in Saigon, AnGiang and T\u00e2y Ninh, and the Ch\u0103m from Cambodia follow Islam, those living in B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn, Ninh Thu\u1eadn provinces follow Brahmanism. Islam is modified to suit the people here and is called 'Ban\u00ed. The Ch\u0103m language is of the+Malayo-Polynesian family and is spoken by about 250,000 people (G Moussay, Dictionaire Cham-Vietnamien-Francais, published by Phan Rang Culture Centre 1971). However, it does not necessarily follow that the Ch\u0103m in different regions can fully understand each other. It is natural that the Ch\u0103m borrow local words and expressions at the place they reside, mainly from Kh\u01a1 Me and Vietnamese. In terms of their script, only the Cham Dong (in B\u00ecnh Thu\u1eadn, Ninh Thu\u1eadn provinces) have preserved their original script. The Ch\u0103m script is now being taught at elementary school to help maintain this unique linguistic tradition. The Ch\u0103m also+utilised the Akhar Thrah scripts from Nam An which has been incorporated into present-day Ch\u0103m scripts. Ancient texts written on papyrus or paper+used both of these scripts and include various epics and love stories such as the Devamuno Inra Patra, Ummurup, Cambini, Bini-Cam, Sah Pakei, Patauw Kamai, Patauw adat Likei etc. This ancient literature gives a clear picture of the life and society of the Ch\u0103m through history. Together with academic literature, the Ch\u0103m also have very rich popular literature+which comprises hundreds of stories, sayings, idioms, puzzles, songs etc., which make up a precious literary tradition. Ch\u0103m people have songs for+fishing using the 'vai chai' rhythm (pwoc jah), betrothals (danh dom da ra), milling rice (danh rasung chai) etc. These rhythms are also sung during festivities with dances which have become a real attraction to spectators. Surely the greatest and most unique contribution from the Ch\u0103m culture is their architecture and carvings Historical stupa compounds in M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n (Qu\u1ea3ng Nam-\u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng), Th\u00e1p B\u00e0 (Nha Trang), Th\u00e1p Ch\u00e0m (Ninh Thu\u1eadn) and various Tara statues in \u0110\u00f4ng D\u01b0\u01a1ng, and Apsaras in Tr\u00e0 Ki\u1ec7u have all had their position+confirmed in the Southeast Asian sculptural tradition.+Though most of these works were created for religious purposes and stemmed from Brahmin spiritualism, they became popularised and part of the Ch\u0103m+national culture. As such, the Indian-inspired Vishnus, and Shivas went through considerable transformations and became more human when recreated by Ch\u0103m artisans.=In the present day, the Ch\u0103m people have adjusted their lives to local conditions. People in T\u00e2y Ninh mostly work in agriculture, fishing and+commerce while those who live near Saigon have developed an urban lifestyle. The majority, however, still maintain traditional professions like cultivation, husbandry, weaving and ceramic production. Ch\u0103m+handicrafts are now exported to various countries where they are highly appreciated due to their unique style and high quality workmanship\n"}, {"word": "ch\u0103m", "pronunciation": "",

Ch\u00e8o (Traditional operetta) is an original synthesis of folk songs, dances and narration. The words of the play are imbued with the lyricism of folk songs, proverbs and popular sayings. A Ch\u00e8o play could be put on stage in a large theatre, but it also could be performed successfully on one or two bed mats spread in the middle of a communal house with a cast of only three: a hero, a heroine and a clown. The clown in a Ch\u00e8o play seems to be a supporting role, but actually he or she is very important to the performance. The clowns present a comic portrayal of social life, with ridiculous and satirical words and gestures they reduce the audience to tears of laughter. The national Ch\u00e8o repertoire includes among others Truong Vien, Kim Nhan, L\u01b0u B\u00ecnh D\u01b0\u01a1ng L\u1ec5 and Quan Am Th\u1ecb K\u00ednh, which are considered treasures of the

"", "definition": "* noun\n- Gong\n- Gongs were found in Vietnam in the Bronze Age (\u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture from 2000 to 3500 years ago). Gongs were cast in bronze, an alloy of copper, zinc and lead. Gongs are used as a musical instrument by most ethnic groups in Vietnam. Gongs are frequently mentioned in Highland songs, and its music displays its contemplative nature. Highlanders believe that when gong music is played, there is an encounter between the human and spirit worlds, between the worlds of the living and the dead. In real life, the gong is closely associated with each stage of a lifespan. In the ceremony of blowing the ear for a newborn child, the sound of a gong serves to declare the offical acceptance of a new community member. When he or she is old enough to get married, in the ceremony of exchanging necklace, the gong sound is a reminder to the new couple to observe family and community traditions. The sound is so deep that it seems to ring only once in one's life. When beasts are destroying crops or a war rages, the gong seems to urge young people to dash to the battlefield and struggle for the survival of the community. If the gong sounds hilarious and fast, it heralds a victory or the ceremony of killing buffalo. When the gong sounds slow, sinister and heavy, then it is the news of a death. The gong is warm in a night of rest or around a fire with a pot of wine, an indication of a good harvest when young people gather to sing and dance and tell of their love\n-When the gong sounds from the communal house, it can be heard all over the mountain and forest as a call for the young men to return to the communal house. When an old man passes away, the gong echoes its farewell. Virtually, all Western Highland and Long Range tribes have their own gongs. There are various types: C\u1ed3ng (with a nipple) and Chi\u00eang (without one) and there are also different sizes depending on the tribe, each region with its own regulations. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the gong is one of the main instruments in the orchestras of the Western Highland (T\u00e2y Nguy\u00ean) and Long Range (Tr\u01b0\u1eddng S\u01a1n) tribes, used in festivals such as the welcoming of a victory, killing buffalo, forgetting a tomb, and welcoming a good harvest. There are three pieces: Juar, Trum and Vang. Juar has an accelerating tempo revealing the majestic heroism of the victory; Trum (accompanied by a shield dance) expresses the hard but brave fight of the soldiers; and Vang, with a slow tempo, tells of sorrow, grief and regret felt for fallen soldiers. Gongs are named differently according to their size, register, timbre and function: Mother Gong, Father Gong, Older Sister Gong, Younger Sister Gong, or high pitch, medium pitch and low pitch. Hands or sticks are used to beat the gong. Sticks can be wrapped with cloth and/or rubber and a gong can be held by hand, put on the thigh or hung on a frame when played. Researchers all agree that of all the gongs of the ethnic groups, the Ba Na gong is the most majestic, imposing, romantic and echoing; the Gia Rai gong is the most solid, echoing and accelerated. The gong is an instrument of a philosophical and contemplative character. Closely associated with other art forms like singing and dancing, they can also be witty, cheerful and romantic. They are not only the property of the ethnic groups of the Western Highlands and the Long Range, but also bear unique and cherished value for Vietnamese culture as a whole.

An (1292-1370) - talented and virtuous pedagogue and scholar in the Tr\u1ea7n times - was reputed for straightforwardness and not being concerned with fame and advantages. His native village was in Thanh \u0110\u1ea1m (Thanh Tr\u00ec- H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i). He graduated as doctor and came home to teach instead of becoming a mandarin. Many of his students make their way in the world (Ph\u1ea1m S\u01b0 M\u1ea1nh, L\u00ea Qu\u00e1t). Chu V\u0103n An taught the crown prince at Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m, and submitted Th\u1ea5t Tr\u1ea3m S\u1edb (petition asking to behead seven sycophantic mandarins) to the king. Because the king's disapproval, he resigned and led a secluded life under the pen-name Ti\u1ec1u \u00c2n (secluded woodcutter). His works were Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef Thi T\u1eadp (Anthology of national language), Ti\u1ec1u \u00c2n Thi T\u1eadp (Anthology of a secluded woodcutter). There is a temple to his memory at the Temple of Literature in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i\n- CHU V\u0102N AN: LIFE AND TIMES. Chu V\u0103n An died over six centuries ago, in the year 1370, but the example he set as a great patriot and teacher will remain engraved in the hearts of our people. Having won the degree of Th\u00e1i H\u1ecdc Sinh (doctorate) in the official literary examinations, he refused to be appointed a mandarin official at the royal court and instead opened a school to train the country's scholars. Many of his more talented students would later go on to pursue successful careers. Two of his students, Ph\u1ea1m S\u01b0 M\u1ea1nh and L\u00ea Qu\u00e1t, rose to the position of prime minister. In the reign of Tr\u1ea7n Minh T\u00f4n, Chu V\u0103n An was invited to teach at Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m, the National University in the capital city of Th\u0103ng Long (now H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), attended by the most talented scholars as well as the sons of high dignitaries, including the prince heir to the throne. He was the author of many books: Collections of poems in both the vernacular and classical Chinese, dissertations on Confucian classics, and a treaty on traditional medicine The vestiges of his life and career, carefully preserved by the people in spite of the ravages of war and the passage of time, testify to the great respect in which his memory is held. Thanh Li\u1ec7t commune in Thanh Tr\u00ec district south of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i is believed to be the birth place of his mother, L\u00ea Th\u1ecb Chi\u00eam. In the communal house are kept a record of his life and a couplet praising his virtues and achievements. A shrine was also built in 1846, dedicated to him and to a remarkable man among his descendants, Doctor Chu \u0110inh Bang, who lived in the reign of L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n (15th century) In Tam Hi\u1ec7p commune, Thanh Tr\u00ec district is found H\u00f9ynh Cung Temple, built on the site of a famous school founded by Chu V\u0103n An. In V\u0103n \u0110i\u1ec3n south of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i is a stone stele with an inscription honouring Chu V\u0103n An, erected in 1803. But the most important national institutions related to his life and career are the Temple of Literature (V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu) and the National University (Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m) in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. Here the Tr\u1ea7n kings erected an altar to honour him alongside those dedicated to Confucius and his 72 disciples. Also in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, a tree-lined street and a secondary school, the most renowned in the country, are named after him. In H\u1ea3i H\u01b0ng province are found vestiges related to the later years of his life. Here he lived as a recluse for ten years after unsuccessfully petitioning the king for the death sentence to seven corrupt high-ranking dignitaries. The commune where he spent those years is now named after him. It is located in Ch\u00ed Linh district near a beautiful range of hills called Ph\u01b0\u1ee3ng S\u01a1n (Phoenix Mount). His remains were buried there\n"}, {"word": "chu vi", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Circumference, perimeter\n=chu vi \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng tr\u00f2n+the circumference of a circle\n=chu

understand when it is time to gather young grains to make C\u1ed1m. Then young rice grains are harvested, roasted and ground down to become C\u1ed1m. They are put into a large firing pan under small flames and stirred slowly for a specific period of time. They are then poured into a rice mortar and slightly pounded with a wooden pestle, rythmically and at quick intervals until the husk is removed. Following this, the young rice is removed from the mortar and winnowed before being poured again into the mortar and the process repeated. This is then repeated exactly seven times so that all the husk is removed from the young sticky grains. If the pounding is done irregularly and in haste, or it is not repeated for the prescribed seven times, the green colour of the grains will disappear and be replaced by an unexpected brown colour. C\u1ed1m is regarded as a purely pastoral gift. To enjoy C\u1ed1m, it is advisable to chew it slowly so that one can feel the stickiness of the young rice and at the same time enjoy its sweet, fragrant taste. Visitors to Vong village (about five km from Hanoi) during the C\u1ed1m making season will have a chance to listen to the special rythmic pounding of wooden pestles against mortars filled with young rice and see women shifting and winnowing the pounded young rice\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9m", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to bulge\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- stick; cudgel\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4n \u0111\u1ed3", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- gangster; ruffian; hooligan\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4n tr\u00f9ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Insect\n=con s\u00e2u que\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed3n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Alcohol\n* noun\n- hillock; river islet\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed3n c\u00e1t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-Sand-bank\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- peacock\n=c\u00f4ng m\u00e1i+peahen\n#Syn\n- con c\u00f4ng\n* noun\n- work; labour\n* adj\n- Public; common\n=c\u1ee7a c\u00f4ng+public property fair; equitable\n=b\u1ea5t c\u00f4ng+unfair\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng an", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Public security; police\n=c\u00f4ng an vi\u00ean+pubdic security agent; policeman\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng b\u1ed1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- To publish; to proclaim\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng ch\u00ednh", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- danh t\u1eeb, public works; civil engineering\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng ch\u00faa", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- princess\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng ch\u00fang", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- The public\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng danh", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- position and fame\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng d\u00e2n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- citizen; subjects\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng \u0111o\u00e0n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Trade-union\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng gi\u00e1o", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- catholicism\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng h\u00e0m", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Diplomatic note\n=trao \u0111\u1ed5i c\u00f4ng h\u00e0m+To exchange diplomatic note\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng \u00edch", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- public interest; public benefit\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng khai", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- Public; open\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng lu\u00e2n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Great merit; exploit\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng lu\u1eadn", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- public opinion\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng l\u1ef1c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-Police force\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng l\u00fd", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-justice\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng ngh\u1ec7", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Craft; industry\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Industry\n=c\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p n\u1eb7ng+Heavy Industry\n=c\u00f4ng nghi\u1ec7p nh\u1eb9+light industry\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng nh\u00e2n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Worker; employee; workman\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng nh\u1eadn", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to allow; to recognize; to consecrate\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng ph\u00e1p", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- public law\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng qu\u0129", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-public funds\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng t\u00e1c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Mission; business\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng th\u1ee9c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Formula\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng th\u01b0\u01a1ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Industry and trade\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng tr\u00e1i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- State loan; government bond\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng ty", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-company; corporation\n=c\u00f4ng ty tr\u00e1ch nhi\u1ec7m h\u1eefu h\u1ea1n+Limited liability responsibility company\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng v\u0103n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Official dispatch; official correspondence\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng x\u00e3", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Commune\n=c\u00f4ng x\u00e3 nh\u00e2n d\u00e2n+A people's commune\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng xu\u1ea5t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-On mission\n"}, {"word": "c\u00f4ng x\u01b0\u1edfng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Shop; workshop\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed3ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Gong\n=l\u1ec7nh \u00f4ng kh\u00f4ng b\u1eb1ng c\u1ed3ng b\u00e0+the master's orders are drowned by the mistress' gong; the wife's say is more decisive than the husband's\n-Ten years ago, the central highlands resounded with the echoes of an array of gongs. The Pleiku township in Gia Lai province was hosting the first \"C\u1ed3ng Chi\u00eang\" festival (Festival of gongs). Twelve C\u1ed3ng Chi\u00eang bands with 438 artists belonging to various ethnic minorities such as the \u00ca \u0110\u00ea, Gia Rai, Ba Na, X\u01a1 \u0110\u0103ng presented a series of virtuoso performances. Seventy years separated the oldest and the youngest player Three years later, in 1988, participants numbered 1,000 from 14 ethnic groups from as many provinces. The deep sounds and melodies left an indelible impression on the large audience. The sounds of the C\u1ed3ng and the Chi\u00eang (C\u1ed3ng has a knob in the middle, Chi\u00eang has none -- C\u1ed3ng makes the deep bass sounds, melodies are coaxed out of the Chi\u00eang) are the very soul of the highlands. They are played to commemorate good harvests, at religious festivals and on many other occasions like child-birth, weddings, and funerals. Indeed, it is believed by the highlanders that a divine entity resides in each C\u1ed3ng and Chi\u00eang. In many communities, a C\u1ed3ng Chi\u00eang band consists of three C\u1ed3ngs, nine Chi\u00eangs, a drum and cymbals played by about twenty artistes. The compositions played differ, of course, with each festival and occasion --, lively, melancholic or sombre. The C\u1ed3ng Chi\u00eang in Vietnam's central highlands is the subject of study for many anthropologists, musicians, and \"orientalists\". Figures of C\u1ed3ng Chi\u00eang teams can be found on bronze drums which date back to 3000 years ago. This suggests that these instruments made their appearance in the early days among ethnic tribes such as Th\u00e1i, and M\u01b0\u1eddng in northern Vietnam, and Koho, Kor, Ba Na, Stieng, Mnong, in the central highlands. With recent economic and cultural developments, many musical instruments have made their way to the central highlands, but the C\u1ed3ng Chi\u00eang will remain intricately woven into the fabric of a highlander's life for ever. -- ()\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed3ng k\u1ec1nh", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- Bulky; unwidly\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed5ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Gate; entrance\n=ng\u01b0\u1eddi g\u00e1c c\u1ed5ng+Gate keeper (Rail)\n=c\u1ed5ng Nam Thi\u00ean M\u00f4n - ch\u00f9a H\u01b0\u01a1ng\n- Barrier; level crossing\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed1ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Drain; sewer ; culvert\n* verb\n- to pay tribute\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed1ng hi\u1ebfn", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to dedicate; to contribute\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- (Bot) petiole; stem\n* verb\n- to add; to add up\n=to\u00e1n c\u1ed9ng+Addition\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Republican\n=ch\u1ebf \u0111\u1ed9 c\u1ed9ng h\u00f2a+A republical regime\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Communist\n=\u0110\u1ea3ng c\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n+A communist party\n=ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a c\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n+Communism\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9ng t\u00e1c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to cooperate; to collaborate\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed1t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Bone\n=h\u00e0i c\u1ed1t+Bones;remain\n-Skeleton\n-Essence\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed1t nh\u1ee5c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Bone and flesh, (fig) blood relationship\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed1t truy\u1ec7n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-fame work; plot\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- pillar; column, mast; pole column\n=c\u1ed9t bu\u1ed3m+A mast\n=c\u1ed9t b\u00e1o+Column in the newspaper\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9t c\u1edd", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Flagpole; flagstaff; flag tower\n"}, {"word": "c\u1ed9t tr\u1ee5", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Main pilar, chief stay\n=c\u1ed9t tr\u1ee5 gia \u0111\u00ecnh+Bread winner\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- heart\n=l\u00e1 \u00e1ch c\u01a1+The ace of heart\n-Muscle\n-Occasion; possibility; opportunity\n=th\u1eeba c\u01a1+To seize an opportunity\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 b\u1ea3n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Base; foundation; fundamentals\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 c\u1ef1c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- Ravenous; poor and hard\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 gi\u1edbi", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Machine; mechanical implement\n=c\u01a1 gi\u1edbi h\u00f3a+to mechamize\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 h\u1ed9i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Opportunity; occasion; chance\n=\u0111\u1eebng b\u1ecf l\u1ee1 c\u01a1 h\u1ed9i+Don't let the opportunity slip\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 m\u01b0u", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Puse; stratagem\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 nghi\u1ec7p", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Fortune; Assets\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 quan", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Organ\n=c\u01a1 quan h\u00e0nh ch\u00ednh+An adminitrative organ Apparatus\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 s\u1edf", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Installation; foundation; establishment\n"}, {"word": "c\u01a1 th\u1ec3", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Organism; Human body\n"}, {"word": "c\u1edd", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Flag, banner, standard\n=ch\u00e0o c\u1edd+to salute the flag\n-Vexillum (in a pea flower)\n-Tassel (male inflorescence of maize)\n-Chess\n- C\u1edd ng\u01b0\u1eddi th\u01b0\u1eddng di\u1ec5n ra v\u00e0o d\u1ecbp h\u1ed9i th\u00e1ng ba.

The insurrection, however, was soon discovered and crushed and all participants were killed. Only King Duy T\u00e2n was exiled to the Reunion island in the Indian Ocean. The king was released from jail only to be dragged into a re-invasion scheme of Vietnam after the World War II. He was fired at in a suspicious air-crack in Middle-Africa on Christmas day of 1945 as his \"Absolute Independence policy\" was not in line with the colonial aspirations of General De Gaulle. Unfortunately, the patriotic king was misunderstood by most Vietnamese people due to his unclear relation with General De Gaulle. By the 1960s, Vietnamese and French researchers brought to light the relation between king Duy T\u00e2n and General De Gaulle, proving the unchanging patriotic will of the king. In 942, from the jail island Reunion, listening for the first time to the anti-fascism appeal of General De Gaulle broadcast from Britain, king Duy T\u00e2n showed a deep respect and admiration for him. He then founded a war-resistant group operating for the ally- France. With a self-made radio, he recorded and transmitted information to the French Liberation Force against the pro-Germany government at Vich\u1ef5When Reunion island was liberated by the French Liberation Force, he voluntarily enrolled as a Radio maitre aboard the ship Leopard. In March 1945, France was liberated. By the end of the year, subsequent to the abdication of king B\u1ea3o \u0110\u1ea1i in Vietnam, De Gaulle arranged for 100 parachute commandos in S\u00e0i G\u00f2n to prepare for the setting up of a dynasty headed by king Duy T\u00e2n.But V\u0129nh San (king Duy T\u00e2n) knew nothing about this secret scheme. He vigorously believed that the French hero De Gaulle would help him bring peace, re-unification, and complete independence to his home country, Vietnam.+Additionally, he was opposed to the plan of ascending the throne . His political viewpoint was sharply contested and led him to become pessimistic. On December 17, 1945, he predicted his death to his friend and immediately wrote a political statement to express his belief in struggling for the unification of the north, centre and the south of Vietnam. As predicted, the event of his death took place eight days later His statement was veiled in secrecy until 1947 when the Combat newspaper copied and ran it. This delay in publicizing the facts surrounding his death and the nature of his true intentions for planning for a unified Vietnam made him misunderstood by the people of Vietnam. In reality, this patriot deserves the respect of all the peopl\u1eb9In April 1987, thanks to the joint assistance of the governments of Vietnam and France, the king's remains were moved by his relatives to Vietnam and set down next to the royal mausoleums of King D\u1ee5c \u0110\u1ee9c (his grandfather) and King Th\u00e0nh Th\u00e1i (his father) in the central city of Hu\u1ebf \n"}, {"word": "duy t\u00e2n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n-to reform\n-Moderniste\n=Ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a duy t\u00e2n+Modernism\n"}, {"word": "duy tr\u00ec", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to maintain\n"}, {"word": "duy tr\u00ed", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Intellectualist\n=Ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a duy tr\u00ed+Intellectualism\n"}, {"word": "duy v\u1eadt", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Materialism\n"}, {"word": "duy v\u1eadt lu\u1eadn", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- (c\u0169) Materialism\n"}, {"word": "duy \u00fd ch\u00ed", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Voluntarist\n=Ch\u1ee7 ngh\u0129a duy \u00fd ch\u00ed+Voluntarism\n"}, {"word": "duy\u00ean", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- charm;

H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i lies in Red River Delta and is situated in a tropical area having a strong monsoon influence. The name of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (Interior side of a river) has been+derived from an ancient language which is literally known as a land area located in the inner side of Red River. It does not mean that the city is inside the river, but it is embraced by about 100 km of the Red River dykes. H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i has four inner precincts (Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm, Ba \u0110\u00ecnh, Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng, \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a) and five suburban districts (T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, Thanh Tr\u00ec, Gia L\u00e2m, \u0110\u00f4ng Anh and S\u00f3c S\u01a1n). From the time when the first State of ancient Vietnam was established, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (formerly Th\u0103ng+Long) has been considered a sacred and typical part of Vietnam. It was in the autumn of 1010 that L\u00fd C\u00f4ng \u1edc\u00e2n (also known as L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5) - the founder of Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00fd (Post-Ly Dynasty) - removed the court from Hoa L\u01b0 (present-day Ninh B\u00ecnh province) to \u0110\u1ea1i La Citadel which was later renamed as Th\u0103ng Long. As soon as the royal fleet with King L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 aboard cast anchors at the landing wharf in the Nh\u1ecb River (present-day Red River), there ascended a golden dragon. Thinking that it was a good omen for his trip, King L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 had \u0110\u1ea1i La Citadel renamed Th\u0103ng Long (Ascending Dragon). He also had Hoa L\u01b0 - his former capital - renamed Tr\u01b0\u1eddng Y\u00ean. 1397 was the year marking an end to the decline of Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00ea (Post-Le Dynasty). It was the time when the king indulged himself in entertainments. H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly, a high-ranking court+official, overthrew the king and proclaimed himself the king of a new dynasty - H\u1ed3 Dynasty. This dynasty removed the court to T\u00e2y \u0110\u00f4 (Western Capital) in Thanh Ho\u00e1 province. Th\u0103ng Long was then renamed \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 (Eastern Capital). In 1407, the Ming aggressors defeated the army of H\u1ed3 Dynasty. They rushed to \u0110\u00f4ng \u0110\u00f4 Citadel and renamed it \u0110\u00f4ng Quan Citadel. In 1418, a farmer whose name was L\u00ea L\u1ee3i (future L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5) grouped an insurrection army in Lam S\u01a1n district in Thanh Ho\u00e1 province. He proclaimed himself as B\u00ecnh \u0110\u1ecbnh V\u01b0\u01a1ng (King+of Pacification) and led the resistance against the aggressors for 10 years and regained national independence. He entered the then \u0110\u00f4ng Quan Citadel and the next year, he renamed the citadel as \u0110\u00f4ng Kinh (Eastern Imperial City). In 1527, when a new dynasty - Nh\u00e0 M\u1ea1c (Mac Dynasty) - was in the control of the country, the citadel resumed its former name (Th\u0103ng Long). In 1802, King Gia Long established the first court of Nh\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n (Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty) in Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n in the central coastal city of Hu\u1ebf. Th\u0103ng Long was then used as the regional capital exercising+influence on 11 northern citadels. But the word LONG which literally meant R\u0169NG (Dragon) was changed to 'long' which was understood as 'th\u1ecbnh' (Prosperity). In 1831, King Minh M\u1ea1ng established the province of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i which includes the ancient Th\u0103ng Long Citadel and the districts of T\u1eeb Li\u00eam, \u1ee9ng Ho\u00e0, Th\u01b0\u1eddng T\u00edn and L\u00fd Nh\u00e2n. In 1888, after the tragic defeat of Nh\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n (Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty), H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i became a colonial city until 1954. H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i capital was liberated from French colonialists on October 10, 1954. After April 30, 1975, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i was+officially recognized as the capital of Vietnam by the communist goverment. In the old days, each of 36 guild streets in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i had its+name closely associated with the trade and occupation of the inhabitants Now, H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i has 381 streets representing a tenfold increase as compared with the ancient H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i with 36 guild streets only. These are some tourist attractions of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i\n- Ch\u00f9a m\u1ed9t c\u1ed9t (One-pillar Pagoda): Its original name was Di\u00ean H\u1ef1u (long-lasting happiness and good luck). Legend has it that King L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u00f4n was very old and had no son of his own. Therefore, he often went to pagodas to pray for Buddha's blessing so that he might have a son.+One night, he had a dream that he was granted a private audience with Buddha with a male baby in his hands. Buddha, sitting on a lotus flower in a square-shaped lotus pond in the western side of Th\u0103ng Long Citadel,+gave the king the baby. Months later, the queen got pregnant and gave birth to a male child. To repay gift from Buddha, the king ordered the construction of a pagoda which was supported by only one pillar resembling a lotus seat on which Buddha had been seated. The pagoda was dedicated to Buddha\n- Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m (Temple of Literature) was built in 1070 as a dedication to the founder of Confucianism. Six years later, Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m - the first university of Vietnam - was built in the premises of V\u0103n Mi\u1ebfu. Qu\u1ed1c T\u1eed Gi\u00e1m was the first school for princes and children of royal family members. In 1482, King L\u00ea Th\u00e1nh T\u00f4n ordered+the erection of steles with inscription of all the names, birth dates and birth places of doctors and other excellent graduates who took part in examinations since 1442. Each stela is placed on the back of a turtle representing the nation's longevity. During Nh\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n (Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty), Temple of Literature was moved to Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n (Hu\u1ebf Royal City)\n- Ch\u00f9a Kim Li\u00ean (Kim Lien Pagoda): Legend has it that in the 12th century, Princess Tu Hoa, daughter of King L\u00fd Th\u1ea7n T\u00f4n, led her ladies-in-waiting to this area. They cultivated mulberry and silkworms to make silk. Later, a pagoda was built right on the site and by 1771, it was named Kim Li\u00ean (Golden Lotus)\n- Ch\u00f9a Qu\u00e1n S\u1ee9 (Quan Su Pagoda) was built in the 17th century. It is located in the street of the same name. Since 1958, Vietnam Buddhism Association has used this pagoda as its head office\n- \u0110\u1ec1n Quan Th\u00e1nh (Quan Thanh Temple): The three ancient Chinese characters which are still seen today on the top of the entrance to the temple mean Tran Vu Quan. Literally, the temple is dedicated to Saint Tran V\u1ee5 Temples are places for worshipping saints while pagodas are dedicated+to Buddha and faithful disciplines. Saint Tran Vu was a legendary figure which was a combination between a legendary character in Vietnam's legend and a mystic character derived from Chin\u00e1s legend. In Vietnam's legend, he was a saint who had earned the merits of assisting Th\u1ee5c Ph\u00e1n (future King An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng) in getting rid of ghost spirit during the construction of C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel. An D\u01b0\u01a1ng V\u01b0\u01a1ng Temple in C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel (\u0110\u00f4ng Anh district) is also named Thuong Temple. Inside it, there are An D\u01b0\u01a1ng Vu+o+ng's bronze statue (cast in 1897) and a big arbalest symbolizing the magic arbalest in the old days. In Chin\u00e1s+legend, Saint Tran Vu was a saint who had made many contributions in safeguarding the northern border. Quan Th\u00e1nh Temple was built during the reign of King L\u00fd Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 (1010-1028). Special attention should be paid to the black bronze statue of Saint Tran V\u1ee5 Another object of no less+significance is a smaller black bronze statue of Old Trong, a chief artisan of the bronze casting team who had made the giant statue of Saint Tran Vu and the great bell on top of the entrance\n- \u0110\u1ec1n Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng (Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng Temple) is also called \u0110\u1ed3ng Nh\u00e2n Temple, because it is located in \u0110\u1ed3ng Nh\u00e2n village, Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng precinct. Built in 1142 under the reign of King L\u00fd Anh T\u00f4n, it is dedicated to the two Vietnamese heroines Tr\u01b0ng Tr\u1eafc and Tr\u01b0ng Nh\u1ecb. On+the 5th and 6th days of the lunar second month, there is a grand festival at this temple to commemorate the two national heroines\n- H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y (West Lake) & \u0110\u01b0\u1eddng Thanh Ni\u00ean (Youth Road): Youth Road can be compared to a beautiful bridge spanning across the two large bodies of water - West Lake to the northwest and Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake to the southeast. Covering an area of nearly 500 hectares, H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y was also+called Dam Dam (Misty Pond), Lang Bac (White Waves)....Oral tradition has it that H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y derived from a low-lying area upturned by a golden buffalo, so the stream derived from H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y was named S\u00f4ng Kim Ng\u01b0u (Golden Buffalo River). As for Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake, legend has it that in the old days, Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch Lake was where lived the abandoned ladies-in-waiting who were forced to weave silk. Therefore, beautiful silk was called Tr\u00fac B\u1ea1ch (Silk of the Tr\u00fac village). As the biggest lake in the city, H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y is surrounded by many areas reputed for their traditional occupations: Y\u00ean Ph\u1ee5 and Nghi T\u00e0m (silkworm-breeding and silk-weaving villages in the past), Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00e1, Nh\u1eadt T\u00e2n (peach-growing village), B\u01b0\u1edfi (paper-making village). In T\u00e2y S\u01a1n times, Nguy\u1ec5n Huy L\u01b0\u1ee3ng wrote T\u1ee5ng T\u00e2y H\u1ed3 Ph\u00fa (Eulogy for West Lake) so as to highlight the landscapes of the West Lake and Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 (future Quang Trung)'s glorious merits. Now, H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y has been earmarked for the city's major+tourism development center\n- H\u1ed3 Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm (Lake of Restored Sword): The name of this lake is derived from a legend having it that a fisherman named L\u00ea Th\u00e2n caught a sword blade when drawing the fish-net. Th\u00e2n decided to offer it to his commanding general L\u00ea L\u1ee3i (future L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5). Afterwards, L\u00ea L\u1ee3i found a hilt fitting that blade very well. This sword had always+been on his side during 10 years of resistance against Ming aggressors After winning over the foreign aggression, King L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 returned to Th\u0103ng Long Citadel. One day, aboard a royal boat, he took a cruise in the L\u1ee5c Th\u1ee7y lake. Suddenly, a giant turtle emerged and came towards him.+The king withdrew his sword, and pinpointed with the sword the direction of the coming turtle for his soldiers' attention. All of a sudden, the turtle caught the sword between its teeth from the king's hand and submerged. The king thought that during the resistance against Ming aggressors, the genius had offered him this sword to help him defeat the enemy. At that time, the peace was returning, and the genius appeared to take back the sword. Consequently, King L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5 decided to name the Luc Thuy lake H\u1ed3 Ho\u00e0n Ki\u1ebfm (Lake of Restored Sword). In the middle of the lake is Th\u00e1p R\u00f9a (Turtle Tower). The lake abounds in big turtles+aged five or six hundred. When there are the changes in weather, they often emerge or expose themselves at the foot of the Turtle Temple\n- \u0110\u1ec1n Ng\u1ecdc S\u01a1n (Ngoc Son Temple): Initially, the temple was called Ng\u1ecdc S\u01a1n Pagoda. Later, it was renamed as Ng\u1ecdc S\u01a1n Temple, because it+was dedicated to the saints. Saint Van Xuong was a person considered the brightest star in Vietnam's literature and intellectual circles. Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o was worshipped because he was the national hero who led the Vietnamese people to a resounding victory over the Mongol aggression. The temple as it is seen today was attributable to the restoration efforts of Nguy\u1ec5n V\u0103n Si\u00eau, a great Hanoian writer. He had a large pen-shaped tower (Th\u00e1p B\u00fat) built at the entrance to the temple. On the upper section of Th\u00e1p B\u00fat, there are three Chinese characters T\u1ea3 Thanh Thi\u00ean which mean literally that to write on the blue sky is to imply the height of a genuine and righteous person's determination and will. Behind Th\u00e1p B\u00fat is \u0110\u00e0i Nghi\u00ean (Ink Stand). The Ink Stand is carved from stone resembling a peach, which is placed on the back of three frogs on top of the gate to the temple. Passing through \u0110\u00e0i Nghi\u00ean, visitors will tread on the wooden bridge called Th\u00ea H\u00fac. Th\u00ea H\u00fac is literally understood+as the place where beams of morning sunshine are touching\n- NGHI T\u00c0M: A VILLAGE OF FLOWERS? Once upon a time, the King of Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00fd decided to build a palace for Princess T\u1eeb Hoa in a village near Th\u0103ng Long so that she could spend+her time farming silk cocoons on the large mulberry fields. The village was Nghi T\u00e0m, a name now famous throughout the country for the flowers grown here. Nghi T\u00e0m flowers in fact add to the beauty of H\u1ed3 T\u00e2y or the West Lake area in present-day H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i. It is said that Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00fd in Vietnam was not only famous for its glorious victories in defence+of the country against foreign invaders. It paid much attention to the development of agriculture and handicrafts. For long, the village of T\u1eb1m (or the village of silk cocoons) had been known for its handlooms. The story of this village goes as follows: Initially, there were only three basic kinds of trees grown here, \u1ecb\u1eb9 the peach, kumquat and chrysanthemum. Peach trees and their spring blossom have brought fame to this village. Originally, the cultivation of peach started in the village of T\u1eb1m, then spread to Nh\u1eadt T\u00e2n. Young peach trees are carefully tended and allowed to blossom only on the Lunar New Year's Eve. Hanoians take the utmost care in the selection of their New Year branch of peach From the size to the form of the branch and the design of the pot, every tiny detail must be in harmony with the sentiment or philosophy that one wishes to express, in addition to matching with the interior decoration of the house. Kumquat is another species that spread from T\u1eb1m village to T\u00e2y H\u1ed3. During t\u1ebft, most families in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, and now throughout the country, have their kumquat trees inside the home. Kumquat is used by Vietnamese to symbolise \"talents\" and \"wealth\" for the family White apricot blossoms called \"B\u1ea1ch mai\" in Vietnamese are yet another scene-stealer in Nghi T\u00e0m. The villagers of Nghi T\u00e0m consider an apricot blossom as beautiful only when it has six white soft petals on a green calyx. They must resemble the swallow's wings in the spring days. There is also a kind of green apricot which is rare and valuable. Then there is \"Song mai\" or \"Double apricot\" since each flower gives two fruits. The apricot branch should be able to incorporate the spirit. After the flowering season, the branch starts to give fruit which are washed and put in a ceramic cask to prepare apricot wine for the following New Year's festival. Narcissus of various kinds are also cultivated in Nghi T\u00e0m. The people here know the secret of making these flowers bloom at the required time as on New Year's Eve or on the wedding day etc. Each narcissus pot should have about 20-30 flowers blooming to the right degree to express the virginity of the bride. Along with these species of flowers, Nghi T\u00e0m is also known for the chrysanthemum and camelia species it grows. But the concern now is that with the rapid urbanisation of the locality, will it continue to preserve this beautiful tradition?\n"}, {"word": "h\u00e0 t\u1eb1n h\u00e0 ti\u1ec7n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Very thrifty\n"}, {"word": "h\u00e0 t\u1eb1ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- (t\u1eeb c\u0169; ngh\u0129a c\u0169) Never\n=M\u1ea5y n\u0103m nay n\u00f3 c\u00f3 h\u00e0 t\u1eb1ng v\u1ec1 th\u0103m nh\u00e0 \u0111\u00e2u+For many years he has never come back home on a visit\n"}, {"word": "h\u00e0 t\u1ea5t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- What is the use of?, What is the good of?\n"}, {"word": "h\u00e0 th\u1ee7 \u00f4", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Multiflorous knootweed\n"}, {"word": "H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean is a small town located on the banks of the Giang Thanh river and surrounded on all the sides with mountain ranges.

During the anti-US war, \u0110\u1ed3ng L\u1ed9c Forked Road was the main junction of the supply line from the North to H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Trail. US aircraft concentrated a great number of bombs and ammunitions in repeated efforts to destroy the junction and the surrounding area. This less than 0-km section of road had to undergo 2,057 bombardments. A memorable place is the native village of the great poet Nguy\u1ec5n Du. Nguy\u1ec5n Du was born in 1765 from a family of scholars and illustrious mandarins. Having successfully passed the provincial examinations at the age of nineteen, he served as military mandarin under L\u00ea C\u1ea3nh H\u01b0ng. In 1789, Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 (emperor Quang Trung) made a northward advance and drove 290,000 Qing invaders out of the country. King L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng cowardly fled the country and followed the invaders. After the fall of the L\u00ea Dynasty, Nguy\u1ec5n Du refused to serve Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. Instead, he chose to live in poverty for 10 years in his wife's native village in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh province In 1802, Nguy\u1ec5n Du grudgingly accepted service under Gia Long, the founder of Nh\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n (Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty). However, in his heart, he did not like mandarin work and applied for retirement no less than three times, each time in vain. He was named Deputy Minister at the Ministry of Rites. In 1820, he died in the royal capital of Hu\u1ebf. His most famous work is Ki\u1ec1u Story, a narrative in 3,254 verses. With this work, Nguy\u1ec5n Du stands out as the greatest poet Vietnam has ever produced There is a house in commemoration of Nguy\u1ec5n Du in Ti\u00ean \u0110i\u1ec1n village.

On the southern bank of Perfume River, construction has started beside the H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang Hotel for the new, three-star, 138-room Hu\u1ebf Hotel. Hu\u1ebf is one of the three biggest tourist centres of Vietnam. Its attraction lies first of all in the many temples, palaces and mausoleums of Nh\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n (Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty) built between 1805 and 1832. The old citadel measures 11 kilometres in circumference with a 21-metre thick wall and a flagpole standing 54.4 metres high. The Nguy\u1ec5n kings, from T\u1ef1 \u0110\u1ee9c and Minh M\u1ea1ng to \u0110\u1ed3ng Kh\u00e1nh and Thi\u1ec7u Tr\u1ecb were buried in mausoleums of different architectural styles. Hu\u1ebf also boasts nearly one hundred Buddhist pagodas and temples. Visitors should not miss Thi\u00ean M\u1ee5 Pagoda built in 1601 on a very poetic site on the bank of Perfume River, or the T\u1eeb \u0110\u00e0m pagoda.=Among Hu\u1ebf's many tourist attractions are Perfume River, Ng\u1ef1 Mountain, Tr\u00e0ng Ti\u1ec1n and Ph\u00fa Xu\u00e2n bridges, V\u1ecdng C\u1ea3nh (Belvedere) Hill, B\u1ea1ch M\u00e3 (White Horse) Mountain, H\u1ea3i V\u00e2n Pass, Tam Giang Lagoon, Thu\u1eadn An and C\u1ea3nh D\u01b0\u01a1ng beaches and further north, the C\u1eeda T\u00f9ng and C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t estuaries. Hu\u1ebf also boasts the National College which was attended by patriotic Vietnameses, Duong Mo village with fascinating records from the fight against the French, and the museum devoted to Phan B\u1ed9i Ch\u00e2u, a prominent patriot during the early years of French domination. From Hu\u1ebf, you can rent a car from the Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean - Hu\u1ebf tourist company to visit the system of tunnels in Vinh Moc village dug during the Vietnam war and Hi\u1ec1n L\u01b0\u01a1ng bridge at the demarcation line established between North and South Vietnam following the 1954 Geneva Conference. Then you can proceed to C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean and D\u1ed1c Mi\u1ebfu, famous battle sites where vestiges of the US defence line are till visible, and further west, the mysterious H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Trail. Visitors will never be bored by monotony or repetition during a ten-day or five-day package tour of Hu\u1ebf. If you are an admirer of antiquities, you may order a \"royal feast\" at the H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang Hotel or sit on a \"dragon\" rowboat (which used to cater for the royal family only) and listen to the mellow song of young girls rowing. If you want to watch the quiet glory of dusk over the Huong River you can hire a room at the H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang or Hu\u1ebf hotels. If you like to listen to the lapping of sea waves, go to T\u00e2n M\u1ef9 Hotel on the beach at Thu\u1eadn An. If you want a completely still night, you may choose Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e1 or Morin hotels. Wherever you go you will be treated to the most varied traditional dishes of Hu\u1ebf, prepared and served by lovely girls dressed in the violet \"\u00e1o d\u00e0i\" (long gown) which is also a typical feature of Hu\u1ebf.=From H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i or Saigon, you can reach Hu\u1ebf by air, land and water. A twice weekly air service has just been inaugurated between Ph\u00fa B\u00e0i airport in Hu\u1ebf and T\u00e2n S\u01a1n Nh\u1ea5t airport in Th\u00e0nh Ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh. A similar service will soon operate between Hu\u1ebf and H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, and arrangements are being made with Thai Airlines to link Ph\u00fa B\u00e0i with Bangkok. In 1991 the Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean - Hu\u1ebf tourist company received 60,000 guests including 10,000 foreigners. Investment on infrastructure will increase from 4.2 billion dong in 1991 to 10.5 billion this year.With its present capacity, Hu\u1ebf can receive at any one time 1,100 guests at both state-owned hotels which have more than 500 rooms, plus at private mini-hotels and homes To know more about Hue, please search the entry Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean - Hu\u1ebf\n"}, {"word": "hu\u1ec7", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- lily\n"}, {"word": "hu\u1ec7 c\u1ed1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- (t\u1eeb c\u0169;

It has 40 to 50 years' experience, has the biggest number of cages and produces more caged fish than any other locality in the country. It is no exaggeration to say that the fishing rafts on AnGiang rivers are true floating villages.If you ever come to AnGiang, do not fail to visit C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean where you can fully appreciate the poetic nature of such villages. They are made of large rafts of either bamboo or timber depending on the capabilities of the fish raisers. In most cases, they are timber rafts measuring about 12 by 5 metres and 3 metres in height. After five months -- the usual time for the fish to complete their life cycle -- the family of the fish raiser anchors the raft on some part of the Ti\u1ec1n, H\u1eadu, or Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c rivers or any major canals. At present, most districts in AnGiang such as Long Xuy\u00ean, Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c, Ch\u1ee3 M\u1edbi, Ph\u00fa T\u00e2n, Ph\u00fa Ch\u00e2u and Ch\u00e2u Ph\u00fa raise caged fish, but this occupation is still essentially practised in C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean village, Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c township C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean has the advantage of being located near the supply centre for young fish and fish meal (the Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c market) and also on a fast-flowing river. C\u1ed3n Ti\u00ean actually accounts for almost half of all the fish rafts of AnGiang provinc\u1eb9The two main fish species raised in cages in AnGiang are the Ba Sa and Chai which take their food from the water surface. Their food consists chiefly of rice bran mixed with vegetables such as pumpkin.A raft for rearing 50,000 Ba Sa fish needs about 3,500 kilograms of food, but for rearing 10,000 to 20,000 Chai, only 00 to 800 kilos of food are required. One raft needs only three workhands. The first harvest from a raft averages 12 tonnes of Ba Sa and three tonnes of he or Chai fish.+Net profit may account for 25 % - 30 % of the proceeds. But not everything has been plain sailing for the fish raisers of AnGiang. At its peak year, AnGiang had 1,200 rafts. In 1971, there were only 662 and the number slumped to 225 in 1980. A rapid recovery began in 1984, when the local government decreed new policies on prices and on the rearing and marketing of caged fish. Early in 1990, the AnGiang Aquatic Produce Import- Export Company loaned fish raisers three billion dong. It also found markets for caged fish in Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. Subsequently, the number of rafts rose to 715 and fish output to 14,000 tonnes, double the figures for 1989. The expansion also provided jobs for 4,000 people. One of the biggest problems in caged fish raising in AnGiang is the supply of young fish, since most of them come from natural breeding. Production of all other fish still depends on natural breeding. Research and experimentation in this direction with regard to fish such as Ba Sa, Chai and Bong are going on at the provincial sciences committee. In recent years, caged fish raising has also been undertaken by other provinces such as H\u00e0 T\u00e2y, H\u00e0 B\u1eafc and V\u0129nh Ph\u00fa in the north and H\u1eadu Giang, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p and Long An in the south. In H\u00e0 T\u00e2y province west of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, 200 families in the district of Ba V\u00ec, Dan Ph\u01b0\u01a1ng and M\u1ef9 \u0110\u1ee9c keep more than 200 fish cages along the \u0110\u00e0 and Red Rivers. Ba V\u00ec district alone has 165 cages, mainly raising Indian carp. They yield from two to three tonnes of fish per cage. On average, the fish raisers get from 16 to 24 million dong in income and about seven million in net profit. Riverside villages such as Thuan My, Tay Dang, Co Do and Minh Ch\u00e2u are gradually shifting from fishing in the river to raising fish in cages. The administration in Ba V\u00ec has made a uniform loan of one million dong to every family of fish raisers. Experts are providing technical assistance to make fish spawn in the rivers, thus reducing production costs. Many families of farmers are also raising fish as a secondary occupation besides cultivation. One thousand families of farmers in Ba V\u00ec district have registered for caged fish raising\n"}, {"word": "l\u1ea3ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n-to slip away; to sneak away\n=n\u00f3i l\u1ea3ng+to turn conversation\n"}, {"word": "l\u1ea3ng tr\u00e1nh", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to evade\n"}, {"word": "l\u1ea3ng v\u1ea3ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to prowl about\n"}, {"word": "l\u00e3ng m\u1ea1n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- romantic\n"}, {"word": "l\u00e3ng ph\u00ed", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to waste;

Originating from China, it has become part of Vietnamese culture. It is performed not only during T\u1ebft or the Mid-Autumn Festival, but also on special occasions such as ground-breaking or inauguration ceremonies. It can be performed on the day when recruits leave their native towns for military units, or on other occasions. If you think that anyone can perform a Dragon Dance, you are mistaken. As an art, Dragon Dance has its principles and rules. A dragon dance usually lasts from 20 to 25 minutes. It consists of five episodes: In the first episode, the dragon appears on the stage; in the second, it exits; in the third, it enters again and rolls over the ground, then it kneels before the audience, and finally bows to the donors. For each episode, there is a different way of beating the drum. Accompanied by the cymbals, the drum sounds like that of a military march. And an expert can distinguish all the five basic feelings of humans (joy, anger, love, hatred and fear) depicted by the beatings of the drum. The drummer not only must be versed in his art, but also knows how to assess the situation. For example, when he sees that the owner of the building hangs the prize on the balcony of his house, the drummer must use the one-three rhythm (cac, bum, bum bum) As the dragon hears the drum change its rhythm, it grows more excited. But when the drum beating is slow, the dragon knows that it is time to wait and relax.A team of dragon dancers consists of thirty persons, as they have to take turns to play the main part. They have different occupations, but when the need arises, they gather at once at the rallying place. In the past, this was an occasion for amusement, not for money.+The part of the dragon is performed by three to five persons, but the most important part is that of the head of the dragon.. Usually the performer must be versed in wushu. Another part requires some skills: H\u1ed3ng H\u00e0i Nhi (a character in the Chinese novel entitled \"Pilgrimage to the West\") juggling with two balls of imitation jade he challenges the dragon to try to catch them and thus perform an amusing dance. A part of much more importance is that of the Monkey (one of the main characters of the aforesaid novel). The Monkey also leads the dragon to enter a house, and leave it. And, more important, he manages to stop the dragon when the latter is too excited and loses self-control in its \"pursuit of prey\".However, to most accounts, the most important role is that of \u00d4ng \u0110\u1ecba (the genie of the earth). He is like a clown in the Western theatre or in Vietnam's classical opera, but unlike the clown, he does not utter any words. He makes people laugh with his gestures. Therefore, \u00d4ng \u0110\u1ecba will be immediately replaced if he fails to play his rol\u1eb9It takes a person four years to be able to perform a part in a dragon dance which usually lasts 20-25 minutes. On T\u1ebft Festival, he has to work for four days running, especially on the first, second and third days of the Lunar New Year. Nowadays, a team of dragon dancers can earn a lot of money - at times, nearly ten million VND. Seventy percent of the earnings is divided among members, 10 percent will go to the bonus fund, 10 percent is reserved for re-investment (a dragon costs up to three million VND). The rest is used as \"working capital\".Dragon dance services are no longer available for free. Those who are interested should order in advance Foreign companies often rent dragon dance teams. In late 1995, San Miguel Beer, for example, offered bonuses worth several million VND. In recent years, the dragon dance has gone through many refinements with a view to catching up with modern times while preserving the best of Vietnam's cultural traditions\n"}, {"word": "l\u00e2n c\u1eadn", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- near;

The Northern Kingdom's Domination lasted one thousand years. This was one of the fiercest trials and periods of hardship in Vietnam's history of national development of the different tribal peoples inhabiting Vietnamese soil. However, the Viet people managed to maintain their particular cultural identity. Such revolts which were led by Hai B\u00e0 Tr\u01b0ng (the two Trung ladies), B\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u (Lady Trieu), and L\u00fd Nam \u0110\u1ebf and especially the historic victory at the B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng river in 938, under the leadership of Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n which finally led the Vietnamese people to a complete victory and they regained their national independence. National Construction and Defence for National Independence lasted about one thousand years (from the early 10th Century to the middle of the 19th Century). This period also witnessed several fierce struggles launched by the Vietnamese people against the northern aggressors. The wars of resistance included the battle against the T\u1ed1ng army in the 11th century, three separate wars against the invading Mongol army in the 13rd century, and the resistance against the Minh army in the 14th century. In the late 17th century, the Vietnamese feudal nation was faced with a social and economic crisis that led to an annexation of the country into two parts. However, the victory of the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n revolt at the close of the 18th century reunified the country. In the first half of the 19th century, the Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty continued to consolidate national unification. Yet, a prevailing conservative attitude among Nguy\u1ec5n dynasty court officials allowed the country to drift into a period of stagnation and Vietnam eventually became a French colony. At present, the Vietnamese people are trying to develop their national economy in a very difficult situation mostly due to the dictatorship of the Vietnamese communist goverment. Now, let's have a chronological summary on Vietnamese history:\n- In the ancient times, Red River Civilization succeeded the native prehistoric cultures. At its apogee, the ancient Viet people's first nations (V\u0103n Lang, \u00c2u L\u1ea1c) appeared\n- Th\u1eddi B\u1eafc Thu\u1ed9c (Period of Chinese domination) lasted 1117 years between 179BC and 938\n- C\u00e1c qu\u1ed1c gia phong ki\u1ebfn \u0111\u1ed9c l\u1eadp (Independent feudal nations)\n= Nh\u00e0 Ng\u00f4 (Ng\u00f4 Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 \u0110inh (\u0110inh Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 Ti\u1ec1n L\u00ea (Pre-L\u00ea Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00fd (Post-L\u00fd Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ea7n (Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu Tr\u1ea7n (Post-Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00ea (Post-L\u00ea Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 M\u1ea1c (M\u1ea1c Dynasty)+\n= Tr\u1ecbnh-Nguy\u1ec5n Ph\u00e2n Tranh (Tr\u1ecbnh-Nguy\u1ec5n conflicts)+\n= Nh\u00e0 T\u00e2y S\u01a1n (T\u00e2y S\u01a1n Dynasty)+\n= Nh\u00e0 Nguy\u1ec5n (Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty)+\n* Th\u1eddi C\u1eadn \u0110\u1ea1i (Modern times)+\n* Th\u1eddi Hi\u1ec7n \u0110\u1ea1i (Present times)\n- Incontestably, Phong Tr\u00e0o Y\u00eau N\u01b0\u1edbc (Patriotic movements) always feature the heroic Vietnamese history. To have an overview of the Vietnamese culture, see also C\u00e1c N\u1ec1n V\u0103n Ho\u00e1 \u1ed6 Vi\u1ec7t Nam \n- Restoration of cultural and historical monuments in Vietnam: Vietnam has 979 classified national monuments relics including 497 historical monuments, 440 ancient architectures (pagodas, temples and communal houses), 30 scenic places and 12 archaeological sites. Thirty years of war have inflicted serious damage on these monuments. Some have been almost completely destroyed like the old citadel at Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb in Central Vietnam. Others were heavily damaged such as many temples, pagodas, churches and other places of worship in northern Vietnam Nature has also taken its toll. Conservation work has been compounded by growing appropriation of public lands by people for house construction, especially in the towns The government has taken positive steps in recent years to restore some of the most significant historical relies like the old capital in Hu\u1ebf, central Vietnam, C\u1ed5 Loa Citadel, the first capital of Vietnam, the ancient capital of Hoa L\u01b0 in Nam H\u00e0 province, or the temples of the H\u00f9ng Kings, founders of the Vietnamese nation nearly 4,000 years ago. Conservationists are all interested in preserving original features. They have received helpful assistance in expertise from many countries, like Poland's assistance in the restoration of Ch\u0103m towers in Central Vietnam, assistance from UNESCO and Japan in the restoration of old Hu\u1ebf and H\u1ed9i An and German assistance in the restoration of B\u00fat Th\u00e1p Pagoda in H\u00e0 B\u1eafc provinc\u1eb9One major problem is the destruction caused by termites to iron-wood pillars in temples and pagodas. Vietnamese restorers have found a solution by drawing upon the experience of builders in the past. A common method is either to fill hollowed-out pillars with concrete or to replace them with new ones. But both have their drawbacks. In the first case, the concrete would detach from the wood within a few years. In the latter case, the cost involved and the risk of collapse during the replacement would be high.To solve the problem, Vietnamese restorers have combined the use of traditional termite killers with the spraying of chemicals into the infested pillars. That would both kill the insects and prevent the growth of fungi. They can gnaw away each year from 0.2mm to.5mm of wood. But what is more damaging is that the humid secretion they leave on the surface will create the necessary environment for the development of fungi. This damage can be best seen at Keo Pagoda in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh province, 100 km southeast of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i, where several hundred iron-wood pillars have been virtually eaten up.=Recent years in H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i have seen the restoration of many pagodas and temples thanks to contributions in money and manpower from the population Since 1991, the local authorities have spent dozens of millions of dong on repairing the Temple of Literature, the first national university where 82 stone stelas can be found on which the names of 1,234 laureates of successive examinations in the feudal times are recorded. Cost of the whole project is estimated at 12 billion dong, or about 1 million dollars.Work is also going on for the renovation of ancient constructions on and around the G\u01b0\u01a1m Lake in the centre of the capital city\n"}, {"word": "l\u1ecbch s\u1ef1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- polite;

However, tocsin is the most versatile with its extraordinary sounds, depending on whether it is found: in the forest, where it is used as a musical instrument, in the village, as a warning signal, or in the pagoda where it is essential for Buddhist rituals. In the village watch towerm, there used to be many wooden fish clappers. Depending on the rhythm of the beating, the villagers could be informed of different events: Festivities, thieves, fire, or strengthening dikes. In the highlands, small wooden rattles are attached to the necks of buffaloes to help their owners distinguish their cattle. These tocsins are oval-shaped ones. Their lengths and thickness also differ. Hence the peculiar sounds made by the buffaloes. In the pagoda, Mo Qua is used to accompany the prayers of Buddhist bronzes. Tocsins are made from different materials Some are made from the roots of a bamboo tree (widely used by the village crier), or from the trunk of an old bamboo (used in the watch tower because of the strident sound it produces).+As a result of years of study, Ta Tham, an elderly musician, managed to develop a new musical instrument comprising a series of tocsins. Thus this concert is composed of four kinds of tocsin: Ong, Qua, Trac and Thanh, meaning respectively tube, fruit, teak and sound. Trac tocsins, made of hard wood (such as teak or steel wood) and placed to the left, can produce clear and light sounds.The musician can use tube tocsins and teak tocsins to reflect exclusive sounds hitherto unknown in all kinds of tocsin. They can mock the sounds made by woodpeckers, partridges, frogs, insects or horse hooves. Since the cluster of tocsins was born, it has become highly valued by many art troupes nationwide. It has been awarded a prize by the Institute of Music under the Ministry of Culture and Information\n"}, {"word": "m\u00f5 t\u00f2a", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- (t\u1eeb c\u0169) Usher, bailiff\n"}, {"word": "m\u00f3c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-hook;

The puppeteers both male and female stand waist-deep in the water to manipulate the puppets making them move about and even dance on the surface of the water. The water serves not only to hide the puppeteers and the puppets' strings but also to create a trembling stage full of reflection, while providing natural amplification for singing puppeteers accompanied by percussion music and fire crackers. Every puppet is a piece of real folk sculpture. It is made of wood, painted with waterproof lacquer. The prominent character is buffoon Teu with a plump body and a humorous smile.

They are used to husk rice before it is cooked, or to crush lean meat to make gi\u00f2, b\u00e1nh gi\u00e0y, and so on. Thus the sound of the pestle and mortar is very familiar to the M\u01b0\u1eddng women. Gradually, it came to be used as a musical instrument producing familiar sounds and rhythms. Through generations, this musical instrument has known many refinements and finally was used as an instrument for a concert by both young people and the old people in the village. This musical instrument dates back many thousands of years and has been preserved to date as a precious tradition among the M\u01b0\u1eddng ethnic group. It might have come into existence long before the Vi\u1ec7t community knew how to melt copper to make bronze drums and bronze bells for musical instruments.=Nowadays, among the M\u01b0\u1eddng community at Th\u01b0\u1eddng Xu\u00e2n, Thanh Ho\u00e1+province, there exist many Khua luong teams each comprising six to eight young girls. They can play up to 12 traditional concerts reflecting the landscape and the atmosphere of the B\u1ea3n M\u01b0\u1eddng (M\u01b0\u1eddng villages)as well as the feelings of the people there. The most typical of the concerts are those depicting \"a wedding party in the village\", a scene of \" Welcoming Guests\", of \"Waiting for the Bride\" and of the wedding ceremony itself. In the \"Welcoming Guests\" item, a merry atmosphere is created through the sounds of pestle and mortar as the people busy themselves with husking rice and making cake to entertain the guests. In the \"Waiting for the Bride\" concert, there reigns an atmosphere of impatient longing for the bride. In the \"Wedding Party\", the stately sounds help people to get rid of the noisy crowd and enter a world of quiet felicity as the bride and groom gather under the cosy roof of their new house. Besides the four main concerts, there are some others such as \"Welcoming New Rice\", the \"Early Rains\", \"Hymn to the Genie of Thunder\". It is hard to imagine the perfection of the sounds and music unless you attend one of the ceremonies where khua luong concerts are performed. The music leaves a deep impression on the audience and, at times, tugs at the heartstrings\n"}, {"word": "m\u01b0\u1eddng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Mountain village\n"}, {"word":

This is shown in many ways. In general, Vietnamese traditional instruments are of simple structure. Sometimes too simple to be called instruments. For example, the leaf-horn has only two requirements: The surface of the leaf should be smooth and the leaf itself not thick. A girl holds the \"horn\" by the edge in her mouth and begins to produce a shrill sound. After a \"performance,\" the instrument can be thrown away. The jew's harp is only a piece of kouniak or ear of rice. Pitot, another flute, has only two holes - one for blowing and the other for fingering - but it can produce music written from the five-note scale. Castanets are simply two bamboo pieces; a bamboo end can become a split drum; a set of kouniak sticks of various lengths serves as a t'rung. Materials for making these instruments are available at home. The worm's silk will make strings and bamboo, kouniak and gourd covering is available in the garden. Further afield can be found bamboo, kouniak, wood, clay, leather, ston\u1eb9.. Only the parts of instruments are difficult to make. For example, with an organ the trick is to stick a reed into one end for blowing. But simple or not, these instruments are so skilfully made as to be works of art. Their sizes are also unique. Clappers can be as small as a longan kernel; the jew's harp is exactly like an ear of rice; a certain drum is no bigger than a lemon. Other instruments are huge. The lithophone, or Ndut Lieng Krak, is 01.7cm long and the Kh\u00e1nh S\u01a1n 103cm while lithophones found in other parts of the world are only 80cm long. The Qui Dien bell, cast in 1080 in the times of Nh\u00e0 H\u1eadu L\u00fd and Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ea7n, needed a 26 meter-high bell tower to house it. Another bell of the same period was cast in about 4,200 tonnes of bronze. The Van Ban bell with 180 tons in weight, made under Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ea7n, is 127cm high and has a diameter 74 cm. The bronze drum, especially the Son Dong drum, is huge, imposing and beautiful. The Thunder drum, which sounds like thunder, has a 148 cm diameter and is 170 cm high Some drums have a circumference of two metres and are made from the trunk of a banyan tree. Gongs and cymbals range from saucer-size to a plate 90cm in diameter. The different sizes mean that Vietnamese traditional instruments all carry characteristics stemming from the artistic creativity of the people.=The \u0111\u00e0n nguy\u1ec7t, moon-shaped lute, and \u0111\u00e0n d\u00e2y, lute, both have high+frets and strings which are never too tight - and not without reason. The strings must be made from worm's thread and the strings and frets are made longer and higher so that the musician can use luring and stressing techniques. The traverse flute, the end-blown flute, the Vietnamese trumpet, the pi-let, the xa-ra-nai- traditional instruments of various ethnic groups-all have plain finger holes without finger devices so that the musician is free to use luring and stressing techniques. The Sing Tien-a type of clapper- is a very simple instrument, but a really creative combination of three well-known instruments: The guiro, the maracas and castanets. All these instruments have made their contributions to traditional Vietnamese music. But the instruments designed so long ago suffer some limitations. One of these is low volume. With the exception of idiophones, membranophones and some wind instruments, almost all traditional instruments make a low sound with short vibrations\n- Nevertheless, their capacity is both abundant and unique. On the \u0111\u00e0n nguy\u1ec7t, the musician is able to \"stress\" a note making it a triple-interval higher note or vice versa. The \u0111\u00e0n d\u00e2y, a type of lute, also has available a \"loose stress\" and on the \u0111\u00e0n b\u1ea7u, monocord, a half-note, a third of a note, a quarter of a note and perhaps even less than a quarter of a note can be created. An even more subtle characteristic of the monocord is that the fingered string, touched, can produce a note lower than that made by the unfingered string. This cannot be done on any other instruments. The one-stringed monocord has a three-octave range, although some improved monocords have a four-octave range. The klongput makes sound without being touched by the musician Another technique worthy of study is that which allows musicians to play such horns as pile and xaranai to make a continuous sound without pausing or stopping. Vietnamese traditional instruments are close to the lives of the people and their activities. Vietnamese instruments - particularly primitive instruments - are part of their activities.=The Th\u00e1i make the tang bu from bamboo poles and water bags; from pestal and mortar the M\u01b0\u1eddng make the Duong; from sticks to make holes in the ground for sowing, the Kh\u01a1mu make the Kle Kla; others are the ding pa, klong put of the highlanders; the stones hung over a waterfall to make a sound when struck together and used to drive off beasts gave these groups the inspiration to make the very ancient lithophone; an elevated wicker string above a plank-covered hole is called rong Quan and was the prototype for the fantastic monocord; the Phong Ti\u00eau, a type of flute, which reminds the listener of a kite flute and the To diep, Ky pa are not remote from the highland hunters' beast-calling horn; the never-ending sound of the wind in caves and caverns, or on hills where kouniaks have been felled, served as tangible models for highlanders voong to be hung before the Nh\u00e0 R\u00f4ng, or village hall, so that the wind makes a concert throughout the year. The lithophone is both musical instrument and a holy object. The gong and the cymbal are both musical instruments and precious and religious objects. Vietnam's musical instruments spring from real life and were made by creative laborers. The instruments were, and are, crucial to cultural life\n"}, {"word": "nh\u1ea1c gia", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- (c\u0169, trang tr\u1ecdng) in-laws, one's wife'c parents\n"}, {"word": "nh\u1ea1c h\u00e1t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- c\u0169ng n\u00f3i thanh nh\u1ea1c Vocal music\n"}, {"word": "nh\u1ea1c kh\u00fac", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Pice of music, air\n"}, {"word": "nh\u1ea1c k\u1ecbch", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Opera\n"}, {"word": "nh\u1ea1c m\u1eabu", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- (c\u0169, trang tr\u1ecdng) Mother-in-law, one's wife's mother\n"}, {"word": "nh\u1ea1c nh\u1eb9", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Light misic\n"}, {"word": "nh\u00e1ch", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Leathery\n=Th\u1ecbt b\u00f2 gi\u00e0 dai nh\u00e1ch+Beef of an old ox is leathery\n=Nhanh nh\u00e1ch (l\u00e1y, \u00fd t\u0103ng)\n"}, {"word": "nhai", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to chew;

The fruit is as small as the tip of the thumb. Inside the thin and lightly brown skin is the transparently white pulp which covers a smaller glossy black seed. The thicker the pulp is, the juicier and the more fragrant the longan is. Longan is a kind of rich protein fruit. It is usually made one of the main ingredients to make lotus seed added Longan sweet soup which is very precious for refreshments in summer. Seedless Longan, when being dried, is called dried Longan.

The main ingredients include grated pieces of turnip, cabbage or papaya and slices of cucumber with grated boiled lean pork. Other auxiliary ingredients are grated carrot, slices of hot chilly and broken roasted groundnuts. These are used to make the dish more colourful. All are mixed thoroughly before being soaked in vinegar, sugar, garlic, hot chilly and seasoned with salt.

During the ceremony, farmers pray to heaven to grant them blessings. As Vietnam is an agricultural country where labour-intensive wet-rice is grown, the life of the majority of people is closely linked with the land. Hence, almost all ceremonies and rituals are connected with farming. Wet-rice is grown in very difficult natural conditions, especially in the Red River Delta and central Vietnam where natural calamities - typhoons, flooding, drought and pests - are a constant menace for the peasantry. In the past, in the absence of science and technology, Vietnamese farmers believed in mysterious forces which decided their success or failure. This faith is found in such folk songs as \"Thanks to heaven which grants us good weather conditions\" or \"I pray to heaven to bring rain so that I can have enough water to drink and cover my fields\". Heaven (or Tr\u1eddi in Vietnamese) is a common appellation for the spirit world. The belief in the power of spirits is handed down from generation to generation, so that even now our farmers turn to spirits for assistance. Hence the existence of so many farming-related ceremonies. In the past, there were two main rice crops: the M\u00f9a and the Chi\u00eam Depending on climate and local understanding, farmers regard the Chi\u00eam as the main crop, or vice versa. For this reason, L\u1ec5 H\u1ea1 \u0110i\u1ec1n differs from one region to another. In many villages, the ceremony is regarded as a major event in the life of the peasantry. Although the ceremonies may differ in scale, the rituals have many common features. On the day of the ceremony, early in the morning, village notables called Gi\u00e0 L\u00e0ng (elder people) in the central highlands make their way to the communal house where other villagers await. There they pay tribute to Th\u00e0nh Ho\u00e0ng (tutelary god) and Th\u1ea7n N\u00f4ng (god of agriculture) and other divinities; begging them to bring security, prosperity and bumper crops. Afterwards, the villagers head to a chosen location, usually not too far from the communal house, where the ceremony inaugurating the farming season takes place. In a first-class rice field already meticulously ploughed and harrowed, a bamboo tree is planted with all its branches and leaves. The tree is called C\u00e2y Ne^u. Ears of rice are attached to the top of the tree, and having reported to the god of agriculture, they start the ceremony proper. To start the ball rolling, a rice transplant ritual is performed. For this, many Ch\u00faa \u0110\u1ed3ng (Field Lords) are selected. In some villages, only one Ch\u00faa \u0110\u1ed3ng is singled out. They are mostly elderly people, versed in farming techniques and the soil. In addition, they must be kind-hearted people having extended families whose members live in perfect concord. Last but not least, they should not be mourning People hope that the good qualities of the Ch\u00faa \u0110\u1ed3ng will blend into the rice plants and impart great vitality to them. Having paid their respects to the god of agriculture, the Ch\u00faa \u0110\u1ed3ng step into the field and transplant rice around the bamboo tree. In the meantime, the villagers shout cheerfully and beat drums (mimicking natural disaster), targeting the Ch\u00faa \u0110\u1ed3ng. If these people can stand firm on their feet and manage to perform their task well, people believe that their wish will come true L\u1ec5 H\u1ea1 \u0110i\u1ec1n is held in a very simple way, but it is very dear to the  farmers. They pin all their hopes on the good health, prosperity and happiness that the ceremony promises. Furthermore, it is in this ceremony that the spirit of the community comes to the surface. In their hearts, everyone pledges to join forces for the common cause\n=n\u00f4ng nh\u00e0n+Agricultual leisure\n"}, {"word": "n\u00f4ng s\u1ea3n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- agricultural produce;

army to the North to punish the traitor Ki\u1ec1u C\u00f4ng Ti\u1ec5n who would seek reinforcements from Nam H\u00e1n Dynasty In late 938, the king of Nam H\u00e1n Dynasty ordered his son Ho\u1eb1ng Thao to command the navy for an attack on our country while stationing personally the rescue troops in Kwangtung (China). Ng\u00f4 Quy\u1ec1n took \u0110\u1ea1i La Citadel, killed Ki\u1ec1u C\u00f4ng Ti\u1ec5n and made preparations for the oncoming resistance war. The Nam H\u00e1n troops were defeated and Ho\u1eb1ng Thao was killed in action on B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng river. The king of Nam H\u00e1n Dynasty cancelled marching orders and gave up his aggression intention. The resistance war against Nam H\u00e1n brought an end to more than 1,000 years of Chinese domination.\n- Anti-T\u1ed1ng resistance wars: After King \u0110inh Ti\u00ean Ho\u00e0ng had been murdered, his son was too young (6 years old) when succeeding him. On this occasion, the T\u1ed1ng Chinese dynasty launched a large-scale aggression on \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t (future Vietnam). Proclaimed king, L\u00ea Ho\u00e0n (future L\u00ea \u0110\u1ea1i H\u00e0nh) hastened to prepare for an anti-T\u1ed1ng resistance war. In early 981, the T\u1ed1ng navy and infantry rushed overwhelmingly into \u0110\u1ea1i C\u1ed3 Vi\u1ec7t. The enemy navy was beaten to pieces on B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River The enemy infantry was stopped short in L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n and strictly pursued Their commander-in-chief H\u1ea7u Nh\u00e2n B\u1ea3o was killed in action. The T\u1ed1ng dynasty resigned itself to cancel marching orders. Aware of T\u1ed1ng Dynasty's aggression intention, L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t took the initiative to attack it first for a self-defence. In October 1075, L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t commanded the navy to occupy the Kh\u00e2m Chau, Li\u00eam Chau estuaries and to besiege Ung Ch\u00e2u Citadel while destroying its food warehouses Then he hastened to come home to set up the defence line on the C\u1ea7u river for an oncoming resistance war. In late 1075, the T\u1ed1ng troops rushed into Vietnam with the determination of occupying Th\u0103ng Long, but after two attacks, were stopped short at the aforesaid defence line and gradually worn out. In addition, the T\u1ed1ng navy was stopped short at sea In early 1077, L\u00fd Th\u01b0\u1eddng Ki\u1ec7t switched to a strategic counter-offensive. The T\u1ed1ng army resigned itself to \"make peace\", then went home in March 1077. The T\u1ed1ng dynasty's aggression intention was crushed since.\n- Anti-Mongol resistance wars (13th century): In 1258, trying in vain to entice Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ea7n (Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty) into surrender, the Mongol dynasty ordered its 30,000 soldiers to invade our country. Tr\u1ea7n Th\u1ee7 \u0110\u1ed9, Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o) and our king withdrew out of Th\u0103ng Long, then all of a sudden made a counter-offensive. The enemy ran back to China in an utterly agitated state. In 1285, the crown prince Tho\u00e1t Hoan (Togan) led 500,000 soldiers to attack Vietnam. The Tr\u1ea7n troops withdrew temporarily to make a guerilla war before launching a general counter-offensive. The invaders ran helter skelter, and Tho\u00e1t Hoan escaped by creeping into a bronze pipe. In 1287, the Mongol dynasty mobilized 500,000 soldiers (strengthened with navy and food supply fleet) for the third invasion on Vietnam. They were defeated again on B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng River (1288) by the Tr\u1ea7n troops under the command of Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o).\n- Anti-Ming resistance war: Under the pretext of overthrowing H\u1ed3 Dynasty to restore Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ea7n (Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty), two hundred thousand Ming aggressors rushed into our country in 1406. To prepare for an anti-aggression war, H\u1ed3 Dynasty had set up a 400-kilometre long defence line from T\u1ea3n Vi\u00ean Mountain to Nam H\u00e0 (H\u00e0 B\u1eafc). But the resistance was unsuccessful. On January 20th 1407, the Ming invaders mastered \u0110a Bang (present-day H\u00e0 T\u00e2y) - key position on that defence line - and flooded into Th\u0103ng Long on January 22nd 1407. Consequently, the H\u1ed3 army resigned itself to come back to Thanh Ho\u00e1. In June 1407, H\u1ed3 Qu\u00fd Ly and his trusted courtiers were captured and taken to China. Our country fell again to the foreign domination after nearly five centuries of independence.* Lam S\u01a1n Insurrection (1418-1428): In 1406, under the pretext of overthrowing H\u1ed3 Dynasty to restore Nh\u00e0 Tr\u1ea7n (Tr\u1ea7n Dynasty), Ming Dynasty invaded our country. In 1418, in Lam S\u01a1n forests (Thanh Ho\u00e1), L\u00ea L\u1ee3i (future L\u00ea Th\u00e1i T\u1ed5) launched a 10-year insurrection with the wholehearted help of Nguy\u1ec5n Tr\u00e3i. Between 1418 and 1423, the guerilla war endured many disadvantages due to the enemy blockade. Between 423 and 1424, the insurgents made negotiations to keep their strength intact. Between 1424 and 1425, they were on the offensive by liberating Ngh\u1ec7 An, Thanh Ho\u00e1, T\u00e2n B\u00ecnh (Qu\u1ea3ng B\u00ecnh), Thu\u1eadn Ho\u00e1. Between 1425 and 1428, they launched the general offensive throughout the country. Resounding victories were T\u1ed1t \u0110\u1ed9ng-Ch\u00fac \u0110\u1ed9ng, Chi L\u0103ng-X\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang. On December 16th 1427, at \u0110\u00f4ng Quan (H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), V\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u00f4ng declared to withdraw his Ming troops. In January 1428, all the Ming invaders left Vietnam.\n- Anti-Manchurian resistance war (1788-1789): From the fact L\u00ea Chi\u00eau Th\u1ed1ng had sought reinforcements from China, the Manchurian dynasty ordered T\u00f4n S\u0129 Ngh\u1ecb and 200,000 soldiers to invade Vietnam. By Ng\u00f4 Th\u00ec Nh\u1eadm 's plan, the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n troops left B\u1eafc H\u00e0 to return to Tam \u0110i\u1ec7p (Ninh B\u00ecnh) and Bi\u00ean S\u01a1n (Thanh Ho\u00e1). Just after receiving this information (Dec.21st 1788), Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7 proclaimed himself emperor Quang Trung and gave marching orders without any delay. Within 35 days, Nguy\u1ec5n Hue^.'s troops took the Gi\u00e1n Kh\u1ea9u post at 90km from Th\u0103ng Long. In the night of January 28th 1789, they forced the H\u00e0 H\u1ed3i post (at 20km from Th\u0103ng Long) to surrender. In the morning of January 0th, the Ng\u1ecdc H\u1ed3i, Kh\u01b0\u01a1ng Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng and \u0110\u1ed1ng \u0110a posts fell to Nguy\u1ec5n Hu\u1ec7. The Manchurian general S\u1ea7m Nghi \u0110\u1ed1ng committed suicide by hanging himself. The T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army flooded into Th\u0103ng Long  T\u00f4n S\u0129 Ngh\u1ecb (commander-in-chief of the Manchurian troops) escaped by crossing the pontoon bridge on S\u00f4ng H\u1ed3ng (Red River). To avoid the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n army's pursuit, T\u00f4n S\u0129 Ngh\u1ecb ordered to cut the pontoon bridge and an enormous number of invaders drowned. In the afternoon of January 30th 789, Quang Trung and his main army flooded into Th\u0103ng Long. The victory over the Manchurian aggressors was one of the most resounding feats of arms in Vietnamese history.\n- Ba \u0110\u00ecnh Insurrection (1886-1887) was commanded by Ph\u1ea1m B\u00e0nh and \u0110inh C\u00f4ng Tr\u00e1ng against the French. Ba \u0110\u00ecnh referred to three temples in three villages Th\u01b0\u1ee3ng Th\u1ecd, M\u1eadu Th\u1ecbnh, M\u1ef9 Kh\u00ea. The aggressors suffered many heavy losses due to that solid revolutionary base. After two unsuccessful attacks, the French besieged it so severely that the insurgents moved to M\u00e3 Cao (Thanh Ho\u00e1) and disintegrated. Ph\u1ea1m B\u00e0nh committed suicide and \u0110inh C\u00f4ng Tr\u00e1ng was killed.\n- B\u00e3i S\u1eady Insurrection was commanded by Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Thu\u1eadt and \u0110\u1ed1c T\u00edt in response to C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng Decree. The base was very solid and inaccessible to the enemy. The insurgents applied skilfully the guerilla tactics and inflicted numberless damages to the French between 885 and 1892. Later, Nguy\u1ec5n Thi\u1ec7n Thu\u1eadt had to flee in China and \u0110\u1ed1c T\u00edt was exiled to Algeria.\n- H\u01b0\u01a1ng Kh\u00ea Insurrection was commanded by Phan \u0110\u00ecnh Ph\u00f9ng and Cao Th\u1eafng in response to C\u1ea7n V\u01b0\u01a1ng Decree. Their base located in the H\u01b0\u01a1ng S\u01a1n forests (H\u00e0 T\u0129nh). Being able to make the rifles in the latest style, the insurgents achieved the V\u0169 Quang resounding victory.\n- Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean Insurrection referred to the one of Vietnamese soldiers and prisoners under the command of \u0110\u1ed9i C\u1ea5n (Sergeant Can) and L\u01b0\u01a1ng Ng\u1ecdc Quy\u1ebfn. After having killed the French commander, the insurgents liberated 203 prisoners and mastered the provincial capital. 623 insurgents (workers, peasants and civil servants included) had to face more than 2,000 French soldiers supported by artillery and navy\n"}, {"word": "phong tr\u1ea7n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Wind and dust; dust and heat of life, turmoil of life.\n=\"Ki\u1ebfp

The grated rice paper is made of the best variety of fragrant rice called G\u1ea1o T\u1ebb. The soup for Ph\u1edf B\u00f2 (Ph\u1edf with beef) is made by stewing the bones of cows and pigs for a long time in a large pot. Pieces of fillet mignon together with several slices of ginger are reserved for a bowl of Ph\u1edf B\u00f2 T\u00e1i (rare fillet). Slices of well done meat are however offered to those less keen on eating rare fillets. Meanwhile soup for Ph\u1edf G\u00e0 (Ph\u1edf with chicken meat) is made by stewing together chicken and pig bones. White chicken meat served with Ph\u1edf G\u00e0 is boneless and cut into thin slices You could regard Ph\u1edf B\u00f2 and Ph\u1edf G\u00e0 as Vietnam's special soup.

Except for the Kinh or Vi\u1ec7t people living throughout the country's plains and occupying the majority, others find their place on the hilly and mountainous areas and are preserving their very own cultures and dressing patterns. A costume contest for all ethnicities in Vietnam, if organised, would for sure be very much interesting.What excites people most could be the both primitive and modern costumes of some groups like the Gia Rai. Women of this group wear nothing but a small skirt. Men would take just a loin-cloth to go on any occasion. Certainly, this is much more sexy than any modern fashions in the West! On the other hand, many others are dressing quite complicatedly. The H'M\u00f4ng girls for instance would wear a shirt, undergarments, leggings and put on a coiled scarf on their head. Their skirts are usually in cone shape with lots of folds that enhance their gentleness. And it is not less exciting to watch them dance, making the folds wide open. The dressing pattern of each ethnic group reflects their culture, history and conceptions. It also shows their life style and working conditions as well. Also, each subgroup also has its distinction from the rest of the same minority. Take the T\u00e0y, Th\u00e1i, M\u01b0\u1eddng, Dao for example. The traditional T\u00e0y's costume for girls is a kerchief tied in a triangle on the forehead, simple indigo dress, belt and silver bracelets and chains. A M\u01b0\u1eddng girl usually wears a medium length skirt, short white shirt and a pair of silver earrings The Th\u00e1i girls are different. They would wear a colourful scarf, short jacket with silver buttons in two lines and a tight black skirt. The silver buttons and shining decorations look like budding bauhinia blossoms. People of the subgroups in the Dao minority share many similarities while at the same time are a little bit distinct from each other. Girls in the Dao \u0110\u1ecf (Red Dao) keep their hair long and fold them around their heads covered with a red cloth. They wear indigo dress embroiled with decorations in red. It is understandable that these people wear what suit their way of living and the climate they are in. But at the same time, they also know how to produce cloths, embroideries etc. to make their very own dress. One of the speciality they produce is brocade which has become quite famous and made a worthy export product. Nowadays, their traditional dresses have changed to some extend due to cultural interactions with other minorities and the Viet majority. This trend has been shown most obviously in those groups living near the plains where the Vi\u1ec7t people are present. The culture of the Vi\u1ec7t which forms the majority of their population greatly influences other minorities' cultures. Theoretically, this is a normal phenomena. In the last 10 years, thanks to the renovation process in the country, the pace of cultural, economic interactions among all ethnic groups have been increasing considerably. The process of rapid urbanisation can be found now even in hilly areas. As such, traditional and ethnic cultural activities experience deep changes both for the better and the worse. In some regions, it is now a little difficult to find a youth wearing his/her traditional costume. Although the middle-aged are still keeping with traditions like those in Thanh Ho\u00e1 or Ho\u00e0 B\u00ecnh, it seems many of them have been 'Vietnamised'. The farther they stay from the plains, the more they could keep their dressing, patterns and traditions. It is something worth thinking of when there is a clash between traditional characteristics and a modern life style. Many among them have shifted from skirts and loin-cloths to jeans and plants plus a Western style shirt though the things they are wearing are local made and not quite in vogue The new way of dressing has been introduced to these remote areas by local civil workers who have had chances to go down to the country's urban areas or by teachers sent from such places. In many places, traditional dress is still overwhelming modern new one. With increasing awareness, ethnic people are trying to preserve their dressing patterns in a modern society, combining them to make new designs. This proves to be a good trend worth studying. Modernity does not always coincides with beauty. Fashion development should incorporate both cultural traditions and modern life For these ethnic people, there would be no traditional festivals held if their traditional dresses were dropped out. There would be no more cloth ball contests of the Th\u00e1i if these people wear fashion wears. Many Vietnamese as well as foreign tourists have found themselves infatuated by the r\u01b0\u1ee3u c\u1ea7n (wine pot to be drunk together) and the Th\u00e1i girls' dance in their on-stilts houses. The guests would fly with the dance rhythms. And that is what is attracting tourists to Mai Ch\u00e2u (Ho\u00e0 B\u00ecnh province)\n"}, {"word": "qu\u1ea7n b\u00f2", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Jeans\n"}, {"word": "qu\u1ea7n ch\u00fang", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- masses;

But its flavour differs from one area to another. In S\u01a1n La (some 300 km north-west of H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i), for example, where the Th\u00e1i ethnic groups are to be found, people drink r\u01b0\u1ee3u c\u1ea7n in their own special way. It is drunk on several occasions: T\u1ebft festival, wedding parties, ground-breaking ceremonies or other festive days. The jar containing the wine is put at a fixed place (in the middle of the house or the yard), so that as many people as possible can drink it. Pipes are put into the jar prior to drinking and a basinful of pure water is placed beside it. A buffalo horn to be used to pour water into the jar is put on a tray nearby. Not everyone is allowed to drink r\u01b0\u1ee3u c\u1ea7n. And the order of precedence is strictly observed. But there is no racial discrimination: the Kinh ( Vi\u1ec7t) may drink with the Th\u00e1i and M\u01b0\u1eddng. The ingredients of r\u01b0\u1ee3u c\u1ea7n include wild leaves, cassava roots and rice which are washed and put above an oven for 20 days or s\u1ecd Then all the mixed ingredients are wrapped with large banana leaves and left in a corner of the house for a couple of days. As soon as the process of fermentation is completed, the whole brew is put into a jar. When all the guests are seated, the host pours water from the basin into the jar. At first, he invites the guests to taste the wine from a jar whose wine is more bitter than others. This is meant to remind everyone of the bitterness of life. Then a second jar is brought in which the wine tastes more pungent. In the third jar, the wine is sweetest symbolizing that \" your heart can be happy after so much grief\". Drinking r\u01b0\u1ee3u c\u1ea7n is accompanied by M\u00faa Xo\u00e8 (a dance of the Th\u00e1i ethnic minorities) and drum beating. All this is to help the host and guests forget all their daily worries and enjoy to the utmost the pleasure of tasting r\u01b0\u1ee3u c\u1ea7n.

Why is this fruit under such an austere name? - Yes, it proceeds from an immortal love story. Long ago, there lived a young couple in the region. Not being able to overcome some social prejudices, they had to find their death to be faithful to their love for ever. Their own sorrows have received the populace's sympathies, and their dramatic love story has been handed down from generation to generation. To commemorate that couple, locals have named their one of the local valuable fruits Sau Rieng.+Durian is an expensive fruit. It is from five to six times larger than a mangosteen. Its skin is thick, rough and covered with sharp thorns. Yet, with a gentle cut between the edges of the outer shell, you can easily open the fruit to see layers of layers of brightly yellow segments of pulp as if the pulp is covered with a thin layer of butter. According to the writer Mai Van Tao, \"The dense fragrance which spreads near and far and lingers a long time before disappearing. The strong smell can go straight to your nostrils when you are still as far as several dozen metres away from where the fruit is. The fragrance of durian is a mixture of smell coming from a ripening jackfruit and that of a shaddock. Moreover, it also has a strong smell that foreign-made cheese has to offer and is as tastily rich as that of a hen's egg. Others add more traits to the fruit as it also has the sweet like that of well-kept honey. What a specially tempting smell! Those who have not enjoyed the fruit for once could find it hard to eat. Yet, once they have tried it, they are likely to seek for it happily...\"\n"}, {"word": "s\u1ea7u th\u1ea3m", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- mournful, doleful\n"}, {"word": "s\u1ea5u",

There was a time, not so long ago, when T\u00e2y B\u1eafc or the north-west region of Vietnam, was so remote an area that people were scared to go there. In retrospect, the remoteness seems to have been a blessing in disguise. The region's wilderness, its mountains and culture that are unique to it have been drawing an increasing number of domestic and foreign tourists. Tourist facilities in the region are still insufficient, but that cannot stop the back-packers from going there and taking in the splendid scenic vistas on offer. The ethnic minorities and their way of life as yet untouched by modern civilisation are another alluring factor They come here in organised tours, informal groups, or even individually on motorbikes. The sharp bends and curves in the mountainous area are thrilling to negotiate and offer marvellous views of the Th\u00e1i and T\u00e0y tribal villages from the heights, and of the H'M\u00f4ng houses rising out of the rocks and clouds atop the mountains. Visitors can also meet ethnic people in colourful attire on their way to the market or the fields. The population here lives on rice and handloom cloth which are woven with colourful ethnic motifs. The cloth is sold in every hous\u1eb9In T\u00e2y B\u1eafc, weekly markets held every Sunday has presented the same scenes for decades  a couple going to the market with the husband on a horse and the wife walking behind; youngsters dressed in their best, chatting, drinking and playing the traditional flute. Friendly as they are, the H'M\u00f4ng and Dao boys do not shy away having a drink with a foreigner and sharing a piece of (maize cake). Sapa is already a popular tourist destination in the T\u00e2y B\u1eafc region. Here also, the visitor can get glimpses of the ethnic minority way of life. These communities cultivate, maize, rice and other grains and vegetables on terraced fields that are major attraction. The age-old practice of the market being the rendez-vous for young people to court still continues, though there have been concerns about it being disturbed by domestic and foreign tourists. In the T\u00e2y B\u1eafc region, however, there remains plenty for the visitor to discover and savour\n"}, {"word": "t\u00e2y b\u1eafc", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun,

\u0110\u00e1n (Lunar New Year's Day) is very sacred. The T\u1ebft season usually falls on either the second half of the first calendar month, or the early days of the second calendar month of the year. This is the time when family members together make food, fruit and incense offerings on the family altars to commemorate their ancestors. This is also the time for people to visit their neighbours, their friends and relatives. During the first three or four days of T\u1ebft, any visitor who is the first visitor to one's house to offer T\u1ebft greetings would be considered as the first visitor for the year (X\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ea5t). Their good or bad luck would have a strong effect on the house owner's business success for the coming year. The belief of X\u00f4ng \u0111\u1ea5t remains very strong nowadays, especially among business people. T\u1ebft days are always regarded as a perfect time for people to enjoy traditional food such as b\u00e1nh ch\u01b0ng, a square-shaped sticky rice cake, the fragrance of which alone could strongly provoke one's sense of nostalgia for T\u1ebft\n- WHAT T\u1ebeT MEANS FOR HANOIAN CHRISTIANS H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i (originally called Th\u0103ng Long) was an early site for the propagation of Christianity. Phan Ph\u00e1t Hu\u1eddn, author of \"Vi\u1ec7t Nam Gi\u00e1o S\u1eed\" Vol.1 (A History of Religion in Vietnam), writes that in 1581, a missionary named De Pesaro wrote a letter and sent pictures depicting the history of Christianity to M\u1ea1c M\u1eadu H\u1ee3p (the then ruler of Th\u0103ng Long). In 1584, another missionary, Bartholomew Ruiz of the Franciscan Order from Manila, came with an interpreter to Northern Vietnam (then called Tonkin) and Th\u0103ng Long. He was warmly received by M\u1ea1c M\u1eadu H\u1ee3p and allowed to hold his services and ceremonies. In 1626, Father Baldinoti arrived in Th\u0103ng Long and was greeted by Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng, the then Lord of the North. He was also granted permission to hold services for the public. This put the Christian faith in Vietnam well on its way. A real landmark came in 1627, when missionary Alexandre de Rhodes came to H\u00e0 N\u1ed9i on July 2 after Lord Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng returned from his expedition to the South. This event effected a marked change in the propagation of Christianity in Northern Vietnam. From just a wooden hut provided by Tr\u1ecbnh Tr\u00e1ng, Rhodes set up a small prayer-hall to preach his faith and by the end of 1627, he had baptised over 1,200 people. In 1628, another ,000 were baptised, with this number growing to 3,500 in 1629. At the same time, Rhodes romanised the Vietnamese language in order to further facilitate the spread of Christianity. He also wrote a book in Vietnamese called 'Christianity in Eight Days'. To provide a stronger base for Christianity, he incorporated local customs and traditions to his religious festivals and practices, especially during the T\u1ebft Festival period. The New Year festival, according to the local people's lunar calendar, is one of the most important annual events for the people of this agricultural economy. During the festival, people erect in front of their houses a high bamboo pole called a 'c\u00e2y n\u00eau' to ward off evil spirits. Taking full advantage of this tradition, he advised people, especially his Christian followers, to hang a cross on top of the pole to highlight theTrinity. He advised followers to offer prayers in the first three days of the New Year to the Holy Father, Holy Son and Holy Ghost and thanksgiving to the Trinity and saints of the religion. In 1805, the Bishop of Vietnam wrote to all Christians in Northern Vietnam during the New Year festival urging them to be brothers and offer each other good wishes, entertain and dine with each other. This remains a good and healthy practice. These practices were maintained until the 1960s, after which new ones were introduced. For instance, the second day of the New Year is used to commemorate ancestors, in keeping with the Vietnamese custom. Interestingly, Vietnamese Christians have included various Christian festivals in the lunar calendar. Following the Trinity festival and the Candle festival comes T\u1ebft. Thus, they say: 'Ba Vua, L\u1ec5 N\u1ebfn, T\u1ebft \u0111\u1ebfn sau l\u01b0ng' (If Epiphany and Candlemas have come, T\u1ebft cannot be far behind).

The residential sphere spreads from Red River right bank to Thanh Ho\u00e1, Ngh\u1ec7 An Highlands. It is easy for them to mix with native ethnic groups. They settle in valleys surrounding immense fields (M\u01b0\u1eddng Thanh, Quang Huy, Than Uy\u00ean, Ngh\u0129a L\u1ed9), and live on farming, breeding, weaving. The Th\u00e1i people has its own writing and a very developed popular culture\n- In the western part of Ngh\u1ec7 An Province, there reside about 13,000 ethnic Thais belonging to the sub-groups of Tay Thanh, Tay Muoi, and others. Like their counterparts in the North-West of the country, the Th\u00e1i community here possesses a rich culture that has been built up over the centuries. In their everyday working life, the Th\u00e1i minority has developed a rich and abundant culture. Many traditional rites and festivals exist along with other Th\u00e1i cultural activities. In this article, we introduce one particular cultural event - the Th\u00e1i's Cave-Picnicking Festival. According to the elders in the community, the Cave-Visiting Festival of the Th\u00e1i people living in the mountain villages surrounding Qu\u1ef3 H\u1ee3p dates back to time immemorial, and was in existence up to the middle of the twentieth century. Every year during the period from the 3rd through the 10th day of Th\u00e1ng Gi\u00eang (the Lunar Year's first month following Nguy\u00ean \u0110\u00e1n - the Lunar New Year's Day), the Th\u00e1i folk in and around the locality flock to the Cave - Picnicking Festival The event takes place in Tham Mon (Mon Cave) located in the Ch\u00e2u Quy commune, Qu\u1ef3 H\u1ee3p district. The Cave visitors are of all ages, but mainly single young people. They are natives from the villages of Qu\u1ef3 H\u1ee3p and other neighbouring districts in West Ngh\u1ec7 An. Visitors are allowed to enter the cave only once a day until they find themselves a boy or girl friend, and return home when the festival ends. It is an inviolable rule that cave visitors must not bring in a lamp, fire or any source of light.+All visitors come into the cave for the festive occasion amid complete darkness. Young people first enter in groups, then disperse and move further into the dark cave. Once inside the cave, the girls usually gather in small groups of two or three, and stand timidly in the cave alleys. The boys, also in small groups, grope in the dark for girl friends. Every action must be made by hand, and every move made by foot as calling, speaking or shouting are completely forbi\u0111en... Having found a friend of the opposite sex, the boy can talk with and court the girl in the cave. If they find each other suitable, the couple come out of the cave hand-in-hand and go to the boy's home to announce their love to his parents. The parents then take the responsibility of guardianship, by assisting and creating favourable conditions for the couple to become husband and wife. That the Festival takes place in such a dark cave makes it an extremely fun-filled and enjoyable experience. All unmarried Th\u00e1i boys and girls are eager to go to the Cave- Visiting Festival to try their luck at seeking a life companion. The Th\u00e1i men traditionally look for a pretty girl of marriageable age who must be well-built and in good health Therefore, in the cave, a boy first makes sure that he finds himself the right girl, that is, he asks in whispers after her name, her whereabouts and her parents so as not to mistake a blood sister or relative whom he cannot marry. He then feels her thoroughly to find out whether she is strong and sturdy. If satisfied, he then starts to exchange intimacies, courts her and ultimately leads her out of the cave. Such a play of courtship all in the dark cave with the boys fumbling for the girls who hide themselves in the cave gorges or alleys cannot be free of conflicts and jostlings among the men. A struggle inevitably ensues when a boy finds a girl who has a flaw and tries to get rid of her. Similar to practices such as the \"moonlight dance\" or \"moonlight stroll\" of some other ethnic minorities, the Cave - Picnicking Festival of the Th\u00e1i community in western Ngh\u1ec7 An is a cultural activity - a community-gathering place for dating and courting couples.+It is a healthy practice and requires the participants to strictly adhere to the community's rules and customs. In earlier times, when social events were virtually non-existent among the Th\u00e1is, the Cave-Picnicking festival presented a good opportunity for young people to discover and exchange love. The Festival in fact was an indispensable part of the cultural life of the Th\u00e1i people in western Ngh\u1ec7 An up to the first half of this century\n"}, {"word": "th\u00e1i", "pronunciation": "",

province of Central Vietnam. Thanh Ho\u00e1 is composed of three categories of mountain, plain and mid-land terrains. Its coastline is 102km in length. Being the dwelling place of the ancient Viets, Thanh Hoa is proud of the glorious \u0110\u00f4ng S\u01a1n culture (see also C\u00e1c N\u1ec1n V\u0103n Ho\u00e1 \u1edf Vi\u1ec7t Nam). Only 16 km from Thanh Ho\u00e1 City, S\u1ea7m S\u01a1n Beach is very good for bathing. Beside sandy beaches, S\u1ea7m S\u01a1n also has some scenic spots such as Trong Mai Island, Doc Cuoc Temple and Co Tien Mount. Citadel of the H\u1ed3 Dynasty (Th\u00e0nh Nh\u00e0 H\u1ed3) was built in 1397. It was not only the location for the central government, but also a quite military project. All the ancient citadels in Vietnam such as the citadels of Hoa L\u01b0 and C\u1ed5 Loa were made of earth, the only exception being the H\u1ed3 Dynasty Citadel, which was wholly built in block granite, depicting the power of creativeness and industriousness of the labouring people more than six centuries ago. The H\u1ed3 Citadel Dynasty only existed for 10 years (1397-1407), but its vestiges are still surprising because many of its technical questions remain the unknowns \n- B\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u (Lady Trieu) Temple is located at the foot of the T\u00f9ng mountain (Tri\u1ec7u L\u1ed9c commune, Thanh Ho\u00e1 province). This mountain was the centre of the insurrection led by her. B\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u whose full name was Tri\u1ec7u Th\u1ecb Trinh was a beloved national heroine. She led the nation in an uprising against the northern invasion in the 3rd century. Ritual ceremonies are held yearly at the temple on the 21st day of the lunar second month. People on pilgrimage to the temple often recall B\u00e0 Tri\u1ec7u s outright declaration: \"I want to drive over strong wind, sail over strong waves and chase the foreign invaders out of the country, and I will not give up myself to be their servant-concubine\". M\u00e3 River is the largest one in Thanh Ho\u00e1. Nearing the coast, the river meets a high mountain which resembles a dragon's head, from which the bridge spanning that part of river derives its name. In the early 20th century, French engineers tried in vain to built an iron bridge over M\u00e3 River. In 1905, they completed a suspension bridge only to see it destroyed in the anti-French war. When peace returned in 1954, Vietnamese engineers applied new engineering techniques and built an iron bridge. The new H\u00e0m R\u1ed3ng bridge was completed on May 19, 1964. The bridge gained fame because it became the main target of US air forces in the efforts to break the North-South supply lines\n"}, {"word": "thanh ki\u1ebfm", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "*

A famous song from Vietnamese folklore goes thus: \"How joyful to have a Tr\u1ed1ng C\u01a1m; and it is an honour for those who can clap it skilfully...\"The lyrics and the melody are usually accompanied by a picture showing boy or girl drummers with axehead-shaped turbans over their heads and long-shaped drums hung loose from the neck down to about the belly... All these easily mislead the audience to believe that Tr\u1ed1ng C\u01a1m (the Vietnamese cylindrical drum) is an ordinary musical instrument. In fact, in the national musical instrument ensemble, Tr\u1ed1ng C\u01a1m contributes an unique sound - now happy and cheerful, now low, soft and woeful recalling the innermost feelings of one's native country, one's homeland...The drum is held at both ends by a strip hanging over the performer's neck. It thus lie horizontally against the belly of the drummer who uses both hands to clap the drumheads. In the past, people stuck a handful of glutinous rice to each drumhead. Tr\u1ed1ng C\u01a1m is used in worshipping and various ceremonies, in ch\u00e8o (traditional operetta) and in Ph\u01b0\u1eddng B\u00e1t \u00c2m or an octet (a popular ensemble of eight instrumental timbres). The glutinous rice stuck against the drumhead lends its name to the drum (Tr\u1ed1ng C\u01a1m in Vietnamese literally means \"Rice Drum\"). Legend goes that once upon a time, there was a poor Confucian disciple who was very unlucky in competitions and examinations and had to go begging. Everyday, he went past the mansion of a wealthy family where there was always a girl waiting to give him rice. One day, so moved and also ashamed by her good deed, the young man came to thank the girl. She however said that she had done just what she had been ordered to do by her young mistress. Learning that, the man requested to see the mistress, who was a kind-hearted girl. Seeing the poor scholar bowing with joined hands, the damsel hurriedly bent down to raise him and said: \"Never mind, please! I understand and sympathize with your unlucky lot. Since you depart now, I would like to give you a small sum as travelling expenses and this golden hair pin in the earnest hope that one day you will succeed in making both a living and your way in the world and come back to the native land, and then...\". The girl left the sentence unfinished, but the scholar had got the message. Fully conscious of his fated misfortune at the workplace and in his pursuit of fame, he decided to turn to music with a determination to achieve success. As time passed, he became famous. Bearing in mind the old promise, he returned to the native village, hoping to meet again his benefactor. Unfortunately, upon arrival, he learnt that the damsel had just passed away due to illness. In his great lament, the young man brought along his musical instrumentalist guild to pay tributes to the deceased and himself created a small, cylindrical drum with rice stuck against both drumheads in commemoration of the ill-fated girl. The strip from which the drum was hung was made of white cloth symbolizing the mourning band. And as he clapped the drumheads, the doleful sounds echoed his deep pain and the loss of his sweetheart\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1ed1ng kh\u00f4ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adjective\n-empty\n-unaddressed\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1ed1ng tr\u1ea3i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- exposed, spacious desolate, empty\n"}, {"word": "tr\u01a1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- shameless, brazen-faced inert\n"}, {"word": "tr\u01a1 tr\u00e1o", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- boldfaced, impudent\n"}, {"word": "tr\u01a1 tr\u1ecdi", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- lonely, solitary\n"}, {"word": "tr\u01a1 tr\u1ee5i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- nude; denuded\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to turn; to change\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf gi\u1ecdng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to change tune\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf g\u00f3t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to turn back, to retrace\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf l\u1ea1i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to return, to come back (again)\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf m\u1eb7t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to change about\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf n\u00ean", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to turn, to become\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf ng\u1ea1i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- hindrance, obstacle, obstruction\n* verb\n- to hinder, to obstruct\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf v\u1ec1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to come back, to be back\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edf xu\u1ed1ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adv\n- downwards\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1edb tr\u00eau", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- whimsical\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1ee3 c\u1ea5p", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to subsidize, to supply as relief\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1ee3 \u0111\u1ed9ng t\u1eeb", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- auxiliary verb\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1ee3 l\u00fd", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n-assistant\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1ee3 th\u1ee7", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- assistant, helper, supporter\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1eddi", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- sky good, goodness, heaven weather-it\n=tr\u1eddi \u0111ang m\u01b0a+It's raining\n"}, {"word": "tr\u1eddi \u01a1i", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- mischievous, rascal; untolerable blast!

Since 1950, Tu\u1ed3ng has referred to Ngh\u1ec7 Thu\u1eadt H\u00e1t B\u1ed9i (Classical drama art). The Tuong play consists of dances, songs and music which are highly stylised, conventional and imbued with symbolism. Thanks to the stylised, symbolic gestures used by the actors, and a good deal of imagination on behalf of the spectators, the scenery is very simple. Mountains, hills, rivers, dawn, twilight, horse riding and battlefields, are all presented on stage by using a minimum of accessories and technical equipments. Tu\u1ed3ng includes many strict norms on styles of speaking, singing and dancing. In chronological order and by their contents, the Tu\u1ed3ng plays are divided into traditional plays, royal plays, social plays and modern plays. The most popular ones include Son Hau, Dao Phi Phung, Tam Nu Do Vuong, Trung Nu Vuong and Ngheu So Oc Hen\n"}, {"word": "tu\u1ed3ng nh\u01b0", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- it seems, it

It includes two major components which have developed simultaneously and are profoundly interrelated: Folk literature and written literature. Vietnamese folk literature came into being very early and had a profound effect on the spiritual life of the Viets. The folk literature always praised beauty, humanism, love of godness, and contributed to the formation of a national sense. Legends, fairy tales, humorous stories, folk songs, epics... have a tremendous vitality and have lived on today. Written literature first appeared around the 10th century. It had a leading role and bore the main traits of Vietnamese literature. From the 10th to the 15th century, literary works were written in Han (classical Chinese) and Chu Nom. But since the 16th century, Chu Nom literature became increasingly popular, and held a prime position by the early 18th century. Well-known works written in Chu Nom included Chinh Phu Ngam by female poet Doan Thi Diem, Kieu Story by Nguyen Du and the Chu Nom poems of female poet Ho Xuan Huong. These works were the cream of Vietnamese literature. In the 20's, the country's literature was written in Vietnamese Quoc Ngu (Romanized national language). In that period, the country saw drastic changes in its socio-economic structure and cultural life and began to experience the far-reaching influence of Western culture. Vietnamese literature thereby developed quickly in terms of quantity, genre and form. Prominent in prose were Tat Den by Ngo Tat To, Bi Vo by Nguyen Hong, Buoc Duong Cung and short stories by Nguyen Cong Hoan, short stories by Nam Cao, Giong To and other novels by Vu Trong Phung. Poetry also developed vigorously, culminating in the new poetry movement with a generation of famous authors such as: The Lu, Pham Huy Thong, Xuan Dieu, Luu Trong Lu, Huy Can... Traditionally, Vietnamese literature always featured patriotism, national pride and humanism. It was not by chance that great cultural personalities such as Nguyen Trai, Nguyen Du were also humanists\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n ki\u1ec7n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- document\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n minh", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- civilization\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n phong", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- style\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n ph\u00f2ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- office secretariat\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n ph\u00f2ng ph\u1ea9m", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- stationery\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n th\u01a1", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- prose and verse\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n v\u1eadt", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- civilized\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103n v\u1ebb", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- style\n* adj\n- polished, refined\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eafn", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- short, brief\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eb7n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to wring, to twist to turn, to wind\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eb7n h\u1ecfi", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to grill, to question\n"}, {"word": "v\u0103ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to cast, to throw to spit out\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eb3ng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to resound faintly\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eafng", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- deserted, desolated absent\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eafng v\u1ebb", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- quiet deserted\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eaft", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- terrestrial leech a handful\n* verb\n- to wring, to squeeze to throw over on to pull up to cross\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eaft \u00f3c", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to rack one's brain\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eb7t", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- trifling, petty, odd\n* verb\n- to pluck, to strip\n"}, {"word": "v\u1eb7t v\u00e3nh", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* adj\n- trivial, petty\n"}, {"word": "v\u00e2n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- vein\n"}, {"word": "v\u00e2n v\u00e2n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- et cetera, and so on\n"}, {"word": "v\u00e2n v\u00ea", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* verb\n- to twiddle\n"}, {"word": "v\u1ea7n", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- rhyme;

Vi\u1ec7t's residential sphere spread uninterruptedly from the Ng\u1ecdc cape to H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean where the continental and oceanic ecological environments met each other The society was tightly organized in form of hamlets, villages, communes and townlets. Each village was a factor maintaining the traditional social structure of the Vi\u1ec7t ethnic group and where small trade, agricultural and handicraft production took place. Its familiar landscapes resided in rice-fields, gardens, ponds, breeding and handicraft occupations Linguistically, there was the transition from Chinese language to n\u00f4m language, then to qu\u1ed1c ng\u1eef (national language) with Latin-based letters in the late 19th century\n"}, {"word": "vi\u1ec7t ki\u1ec1u", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "* noun\n- Vietnamese resident, overseas Vietnamese\n"}, {"word": "Vi\u1ec7t Nam", "pronunciation": "", "definition": "- Vietnam\n- Different from China in the north, Vietnam referred to the Vi\u1ec7t community in the south.

themselves hundreds of star apples hanging suspendedly from branches. The round and smooth fruits are of the same size. The shape of the star apple only may as well match the name attached to it let alone its juice as fragrantly sweet, purely white as the milk from the breast. When using the knife to cut the fruit, it is advisable to cut the fruit into two parts before using a spoon to take out the pulp bit by bit until nothing is left. The most appreciated way to enjoy this fruit is to drill a small hole at its top and lift it to the mouth and raise the head backward to suck the flow of the fragrant juice into the mouth continuously as if a baby sucking milk from its mother's breast. Don't forget to squeeze the tough fruit for a while until it becomes tendered so that the juice can mix with the pulp of the fruit to become a sweet and fragrant muddy substance that looks like milk
